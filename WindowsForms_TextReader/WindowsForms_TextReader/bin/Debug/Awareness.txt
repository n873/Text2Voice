the nature of his work. He stood up, told a stor
y which he repeated later in conferences, 
and which you will recognize from his book 
Song of the Bird
. To my astonishment, he 
said this story applied to me.    A man found an eagle222s egg and put it in a nest of a barnyard hen. 
The eaglet hatched with the brood of chicks and grew up with them.  All his life the eagle did what the barnyard chicks did, thinking 
he was a barnyard chicken. He scratched the earth for worms and 
insects. He clucked and cackled. And he would thrash his wings and fly 
a few feet into the air.  Years passed and the eagle grew very old. One day he saw a 
magnificent bird above him in the cloudless sky. It glided in graceful 
majesty among the powerful wind curr
ents, with scarcely a beat of its 
strong golden wings.  The old eagle looked up in awe. 223Who222s that?224 he asked.  223That222s the eagle, the king of the birds,224 said his neighbor. 223He 
belongs to the sky. We belong to 
the earth227we222re chickens.224 So the 
eagle lived and died a chicken, for that222s what he thought he was.    Astonished? At first I felt downright in
sulted! Was he publicly likening me to a 
barnyard chicken? In a sense, yes, and al
so, no. Insulting? Never. That wasn222t Tony222s 
way. But he was telling me and these people 
that in his eyes I was a 223golden eagle,224 
unaware of the heights to which I could soar
. This story made me understand the measure 
of the man, his genuine love and respect for 
people while always telling the truth. That 
was what his work was all about, waking people 
up to the reality of th
eir greatness. This 
was Tony de Mello at his best, proclaiming 
the message of 223aware
ness,224 seeing the light 
we are to ourselves and to others, 
recognizing we are be
tter than we know.  This book captures Tony in flight, do
ing just that227in live dialogue and 
interaction227touching on all the themes that
 enliven the hearts of those who listen.  Maintaining the spirit of his live words,
 and sustaining his spontaneity with a 
responsive audience on the printed page was th
e task I faced after his death. Thanks to 
the wonderful support I enjoyed from George
 McCauley, S.J., Joan Brady, John Culkin, 
and others too numerous to single out, 
the exciting, entertaining, provocative hours Tony 
spent communicating with real people have b
een wonderfully captured in the pages that 
follow.  Enjoy the book. Let the words slip into your
 soul and listen, as Tony would suggest, 
with your heart. Hear his st
ories, and you222ll hear your ow
n. Let me leave you alone with 
Tony227a spiritual guide227a friend you will have for life.    J. Francis Stroud, S.J.  De Mello Spirituality Center  Fordham University  Bronx, New York   5  ON WAKING UP    Spirituality means waking up. Most peopl
e, even though they don222t know it, are 
asleep. They222re born asleep, they live asl
eep, they marry in th
eir sleep, they breed 
children in their sleep, they die in thei
r sleep without ever waking up. They never 
understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence. You 
know, all mystics227Catholic, Christian, non-Ch
ristian, no matter what their theology, no 
matter what their religion227are unanimous on on
e thing: that all is well, all is well. 
Though everything is a mess, all is well. Strange paradox, to be sure. But, tragically, most 
people never get to see that 
all is well because they are asleep. They are having a 
nightmare.  Last year on Spanish tele
vision I heard a story about 
this gentleman who knocks on 
his son222s door. 223Jaime,224 he says, 223wake up!224 Jaime answers, 223I don222t want to get up, 
Papa.224 The father shouts, 223Get up, you have to 
go to school.224 Jaime says, 223I don222t want to 
go to school.224 223Why not?224 asks the father. 223Thr
ee reasons,224 says Jaime. 223First, because 
it222s so dull; second, the kids tease me; and th
ird, I hate school.224 And the father says, 
223Well, I am going to give you three reasons 
why you must go to school. First, because it 
is your duty; second, because you are forty-fi
ve years old, and third, because you are the 
headmaster.224 Wake up, wake up! You222ve grow
n up. You222re too big to be asleep. Wake 
up! Stop playing with your toys.  Most people tell you they want to get out
 of kindergarten, but don222t believe them. 
Don222t believe them! All they want you to do is
 to mend their broken toys. 223Give me back 
my wife. Give me back my job. Give me b
ack my money. Give me back my reputation, 
my success.224 This is what they want; they wa
nt their toys replaced. 
That222s all. Even the 
best psychologist will tell you 
that, that people don222
t really want to be
 cured. What they 
want is relief; a cure is painful.  Waking up is unpleasant, you know. You are 
nice and comfortable in bed. It222s 
irritating to be woken up. That222s the reason the wise guru will
 not attempt to wake people 
up. I hope I222m going to be wise here and make
 no attempt whatsoever to wake you up if 
you are asleep. It is really 
none of my business, even though I say to you at times, 223Wake 
up!224 My business is to do my thing, to dance 
my dance. If you prof
it from it, fine; if you 
don222t, too bad! As the Arabs say, 223The nature
 of rain is the same, but it makes thorns 
grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens.224      WILL I BE OF HELP TO YOU IN  THIS RETREAT?    Do you think I am going to help anybody? No! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Don222t expect 
me to be of help to anyone. Nor do I exp
ect to damage anyone. 
If you are damaged, you 
did it; and if you are helped, you did it. You re
ally did! You think people help you? They 
don222t. You think people 
support you? They don222t.  There was a woman in a therapy group I was conducting once. She was a religious 
sister. She said to me, 223I don222t feel supported by my superior.224 So I said, 223What do you   6  mean by that?224 And she said, 223Well, my supe
rior, the provincial s
uperior, never shows up 
at the novitiate where I am in charge, never.
 She never says a word
 of appreciation.224 I 
said to her, 223All right, let222s do a little 
role playing. Pretend I know your provincial 
superior. In fact, pretend I know exactly 
what she thinks about you. So I say to you 
(acting the part of the provincial superior
), 221You know, Mary, the reason I don222t come to 
that place you222re in is because it is the one place in the province that is trouble-free227no 
problems. I know you222re in charge, so all is
 well.222 How do you feel now?224 She said, 223I 
feel great.224 Then I said to 
her, 223All right, would you mind le
aving the room for a minute 
or two. This is part of the exercise.224 So sh
e did. While she was away, I said to the others 
in the therapy group, 223I am still 
the provincial superior, O.K.? 
Mary out there is the worst 
novice director I have ever had in the whole hi
story of the province. In fact, the reason I 
don222t go to the novitiate is because 
I can222t bear to see what she is up to. It222s simply awful. 
But if I tell her the truth, it222
s only going to make those novi
ces suffer all the more. We are 
getting somebody to take her place in a year or two; we are training someone. In the 
meantime I thought I would say those nice thi
ngs to her to keep her going. What do you 
think of that?224 They answered, 223Well, it wa
s really the only thing you could do under the 
circumstances.224 Then I brought Mary back into
 the group and asked her if she still felt 
great. 223Oh yes,224 she said. P
oor Mary! She thought she was being supported when she 
wasn222t. The point is that most
 of what we feel and think we conjure up for ourselves in 
our heads, including this business of being helped by people.  Do you think you help people because you are 
in love with them
? Well, I222ve got 
news for you. You are never in love with
 anyone. You222re only in love with your 
prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person. Ta
ke a minute to think about that: You are 
never in love with anyone, you222re in love w
ith your prejudiced id
ea of that person. Isn222t 
that how you fall out of love? Your idea ch
anges, doesn222t it? 223How could you let me 
down when I trusted you so much?224 you say 
to someone. Did you really trust them? You 
never trusted anyone. Come off it!
 That222s part of society222s 
brainwashing. You never trust 
anyone. You only trust your judgment about th
at person. So what are you complaining 
about? The fact is that you don222t like to sa
y, 223My judgment was lousy.224 That222s not very 
flattering to you, is it? So you prefer to
 say, 223How could you have let me down?224  So there it is: People don222t 
really want to grow up, 
people don222t really want to 
change, people don222t really want to be happy. As someone so wisely said to me, 223Don222t 
try to make them happy, you222ll only get in tr
ouble. Don222t try to teach a pig to sing; it 
wastes your time and it irritates the pig.224 Like
 the businessman who goes into a bar, sits 
down, and sees this fellow with a banana in 
his ear227a banana in hi
s ear! And he thinks, 
223I wonder if I should mention that to him. 
No, it222s none of my busin
ess.224 But the thought 
nags at him. So after having a drink or two, 
he says to the fellow, 223Excuse me, ah, you222ve 
got a banana in your ear.224 The fellow says, 
223What?224 The businessman repeats, 223You222ve 
got a banana in your ear.224 Again the fellow sa
ys, 223What was that?224 223You222ve got a banana 
in your ear!224 the businessman shouts. 223Talk 
louder,224 the fellow says, 223I222ve got a banana 
in my ear!224  So it222s useless. 223Give up, give up, give up,224
 I say to myself. Say your thing and get 
out of here. And if they profit, that
222s fine, and if they don222t, too bad!         7  ON THE PROPER KIND  OF SELFISHNESS    The first thing I want you to understand, if
 you really want to wake up, is that you 
don222t want to wake up. The first step to waki
ng up is to be honest enough to admit to 
yourself that you don222t like it. You don222t want to
 be happy. Want a little
 test? Let222s try it. 
It will take you exactly one minute. You 
could close your eyes while you222re doing it or 
you could keep them open. It doesn222t really matter. Think of someone you love very 
much, someone you222re close to, someone who 
is precious to you, and 
say to that person 
in your mind, 223I222d rather have happiness than
 have you.224 See what happens. 223I222d rather 
be happy than have you. If I had a choice, 
no question about it, I222d choose happiness.224 
How many of you felt selfish when you said th
is? Many, it seems. See how we222ve been 
brainwashed? See how we222ve been brainwas
hed into thinking, 223How could I be so 
selfish?224 But look at who222s being selfish. Imagine somebody saying to 
you
, 223How could 
you be so selfish that you222d choose happi
ness over me?224 Would you not feel like 
responding, 223Pardon me, but how could you
 be so selfish that 
you
 would demand I 
choose you above my own happiness?!224  A woman once told me that when she was a child her Jesuit cousin gave a retreat in 
the Jesuit church in Milwaukee. He opened each
 conference with the words: 223The test of 
love is sacrifice, and the ga
uge of love is unselfishness.224 That222s marvelous! I asked her, 
223Would you want me to love you at the cost of my happiness?224 223Y
es,224 she answered. 
Isn222t that delightful? Wo
uldn222t that be wonderful? She
 would love me at the cost of 
her
 
happiness and I
 would love her at the cost of 
my
 happiness, and so you222ve got two 
unhappy people, but 
long live love!      ON WANTING HAPPINESS    I was saying that we don222t want to be happy. We want other thi
ngs. Or let222s put it 
more accurately: We don222t want to be unconditionally happy. I222m ready to be happy 
provided
 I have this and that and th
e other thing. But this is rea
lly to say to our friend or 
to our God or to anyone, 223You are my happiness. 
If I don222t get you
, I refuse to be happy.224 
It222s so important to understand that. We
 cannot imagine being happy without those 
conditions. That222s pretty accurate. We cannot
 conceive of being happy without them. 
We222ve been taught to pla
ce our happiness in them.  So that222s the first thing we need to do if we want to come awake, which is the same 
thing as saying: if we want to love, if we
 want freedom, if we want joy and peace and 
spirituality. In that sense, spirituality is the 
most practical thing in the whole wide world. 
I challenge anyone to think of 
anything more practical than sp
irituality as I have defined 
it227not piety, not devotion, not religion, not 
worship, but spirituality227waking up, waking 
up! Look at the heartache everywhere, look 
at the loneliness, l
ook at the fear, the 
confusion, the conflict in the hearts of people, inner conflict, outer conflict. Suppose 
somebody gave you a way of getting rid of a
ll of that? Suppose somebody gave you a 
way to stop that tremendous drainage of ener
gy, of health, of emotion that comes from   8  these conflicts and confusion. Would you 
want that? Suppose somebody showed us a 
way whereby we would truly love
 one another, and be at peac
e, be at love. Can you think 
of anything more practical than that? But,
 instead, you have people thinking that big 
business is more practical, that politics is mo
re practical, that scie
nce is more practical. 
What222s the earthly use of putting a man on the moon when 
we
 cannot live on the earth?      ARE WE TALKING ABOUT  PSYCHOLOGY IN THIS  SPIRITUALITY COURSE?    Is psychology more practical than spiritu
ality? Nothing is more practical than 
spirituality. What can the poor psychologist do? He can only 
relieve the pressure. I222m a 
psychologist myself, and I practice psychothera
py, and I have this great conflict within 
me when I have to choose sometimes betw
een psychology and spirituality. I wonder if 
that makes sense to anybody here. It didn222t make sense to me for many years.  I222ll explain. It didn222t make sense to me
 for many years until I suddenly discovered 
that people have to suffer 
enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with 
all
 
relationships. Isn222t that a terrible th
ing to think? They222ve got to suffer 
enough in a 
relationship before they wake up and say, 223I222m 
sick of it! There must be a better way of 
living than depending on another huma
n being.224 And what was I doing as a 
psychotherapist? People were coming to me w
ith their relationship problems, with their 
communication problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help. But sometimes, I222m 
sorry to say, it wasn222t, because it kept people asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a 
little 
more
. Maybe they ought to touch rock 
bottom and say, 223I222m sick of it 
all
.224 It222s only 
when you222re sick of your sickness that you222
ll get out of it. 
Most people go to a 
psychiatrist or a psychologist to
 get relief. I repeat: to get relief. Not to get out of it.  There222s the story of little Johnny who, 
they say, was mentally retarded. But 
evidently he wasn222t, as you222ll learn from th
is story. Johnny goes to modeling class in his 
school for special children and he gets his pi
ece of putty and he222s modeling it. He takes a 
little lump of putty and goes to
 a corner of the room and he222s
 playing with it. The teacher 
comes up to him and says, 223Hi, Johnny.224 A
nd Johnny says, 223Hi.224 And the teacher says, 
223What222s that you222ve got in your hand?224 And 
Johnny says, 223This is a lump of cow dung.224 
The teacher asks, 223What are you making out of
 it?224 He says, 223I222m making a teacher.224  The teacher thought, 223Little Johnny has regresse
d.224 So she calls out to the principal, 
who was passing by the door at
 that moment, and says
, 223Johnny has regressed.224  So the principal goes up to Johnny and says
, 223Hi, son.224 And Johnny says, 223Hi.224 And 
the principal says, 223What do you, have in your
 hand?224 And he says, 223A lump of cow 
dung.224 223What are you making out of it?224
 And he says, 223A principal.224  The principal thinks that this is a case 
for the school psychologist. 223Send for the 
psychologist!224  The psychologist is a clever guy. He goes 
up and says, 223Hi.224 And Johnny says, 223Hi.224 
And the psychologist says, 223I know what you222ve
 got in your hand.224 223What?224 223A lump of 
cow dung.224 Johnny says, 223Right.224 223And I know 
what you222re making out of it.224 223What?224   9  223You222re making a psychologist.224 223Wrong. Not enough cow dung!224 And they called him 
mentally retarded!  The poor psychologists, they222re doing a good jo
b. They really are. There are times 
when psychotherapy is a tremendous help, because when you222re on the verge of going 
insane, raving mad, you222re about to become e
ither a psychotic or a mystic. That222s what 
the mystic is, the opposite of the lunatic. 
Do you know one sign that you222ve woken up? 
It222s when you are asking yourself, 223Am I crazy, 
or are all of them cr
azy?224 It really is. 
Because we are crazy. The whole world is cr
azy. Certifiable lunatics! The only reason 
we222re not locked up in an institution is that there are so many of us. So we222re crazy. 
We222re living on crazy ideas a
bout love, about relationships
, about happiness, about joy, 
about everything. We222re crazy to
 the point, I222ve come to be
lieve, that if everybody agrees 
on something, you can be sure it222s wrong! Ever
y new idea, every great idea, when it first 
began was in a minority of one. That ma
n called Jesus Christ227minority of one. 
Everybody was saying something different 
from what he was saying. The Buddha227
minority of one. Everybody was saying somethi
ng different from what he was saying. I 
think it was Bertrand Russell w
ho said, 223Every great idea st
arts out as a blasphemy.224 
That222s well and accurately put. You222re going 
to hear lots of blasphemies during these 
days. 223He hath blasphemed!224 Because people are crazy, they222re lunatics, and the sooner 
you see this, the better for your mental and sp
iritual health. Don222t trust them. Don222t trust 
your best friends. Get disillusioned with your
 best friends. They222re very clever. As you
 
are in your dealings with everybody else
, though you probably don222t know it. Ah, you222re 
so wily, and subtle, and clever
. You222re putting on a great act.  I222m not being very complimentary here, am
 I? But I repeat: You want to wake up. 
You222re putting on a great act. And you don222t 
even know it. You think you222re being so 
loving. Ha! Whom are you loving? Even your
 self-sacrifice give
s you a good feeling, 
doesn222t it? 223I222m sacrifici
ng myself! I222m living up to my ideal.224 But you222re getting 
something out of it, aren222t 
you? You222re always getting something out of everything you 
do, until you wake up.  So there it is: step one. Real
ize that you don222t want to wake
 up. It222s pretty difficult to 
wake up when you have been hypnotized into th
inking that a scrap of old newspaper is a 
check for a million dollars. How difficult it is to
 tear yourself away from that scrap of old 
newspaper.      NEITHER IS RENUNCIATION  THE SOLUTION    Anytime you222re practicing renunc
iation, you222re deluded. How about 
that
! You222re 
deluded. What are you renouncing? Anytim
e you renounce something, you are tied 
forever to the thing you renounce. There222s 
a guru in India who says, 223Every time a 
prostitute comes to me, she222s talking about nothi
ng but God. She says I222m sick of this life 
that I222m living. I want God. But every time a 
priest comes to me he222s talking about 
nothing but sex.224 Very well, when you renounc
e something, you222re stuck to it forever. 
When you fight something, you222re tied to it fore
ver. As long as you222re fighting it, you are 
giving it power. You give it as much 
power as you are using to fight it.   10  This includes communism and everything el
se. So you must 223receive224 your demons, 
because when you fight them, you empower them. Has nobody ever told you this? When 
you renounce something, you222re tied to it. The on
ly way to get out of this is to see 
through it. Don222t renounce it, 
see through it
. Understand its true value and you won222t 
need to renounce it; it will just drop from your hands. But of course, 
if you don222t see that, 
if you222re hypnotized into thi
nking that you won222t be happy wit
hout this, that, or the other 
thing, you222re stuck. What we need to do for you 
is not what so-called 
spirituality attempts 
to do227namely, to get you to make sacrifices, 
to renounce things. That222s useless. You222re 
still asleep. What we need to do is to 
help you understand, unde
rstand, understand. If you 
understood, you222d simply drop the desire for it.
 This is another way of saying: If you 
woke up, you222d simply drop the desire for it.      LISTEN AND UNLEARN    Some of us get woken up by the harsh realit
ies of life. We suffer so much that we 
wake up. But people keep bumping again a
nd again into life. They still go on 
sleepwalking. They never wake up. 
Tragically, it never occurs 
to them that there may be 
another way. It never occurs to them th
at there may be a better way. Still, if 
you
 haven222t 
been bumped sufficiently by life, and you have
n222t suffered enough, then there is another 
way: to listen
. I don222t mean you have to agree with what I222m saying. That wouldn222t be 
listening. Believe me, it really doesn222t matter 
whether you agree with what I222m saying or 
you don222t. Because agreement and disagreement have to do with words and concepts and 
theories. They don222t have anything to do with 
truth. Truth is never expressed in words. 
Truth is sighted suddenly, as a result of a 
certain attitude. So you 
could be disagreeing 
with me and still sight the truth. But ther
e has to be an attitude of openness, of 
willingness to discover something new. That222s
 important, not your agreeing with me or 
disagreeing with me. After all, most of what
 I222m giving you is really theories. No theory 
adequately covers reality. So 
I can speak to you, not of the tr
uth, but of obstacles to the 
truth. Those I can describe. I cannot describe 
the truth. No one can. All I can do is give 
you a description of your falsehoods, so that
 you can drop them. All I can do for you is 
challenge your beliefs and the belief syst
em that makes you unhappy. All I can do for you 
is help you to unlearn. That222s what learning is
 all about where spirituality is concerned: 
unlearning, unlearning almost everything you222ve 
been taught. A willingness to unlearn, to 
listen.  Are you listening, as most people do, in order to confirm what you already think? 
Observe your reactions as I talk. Frequently you
222ll be startled or s
hocked or scandalized 
or irritated or annoyed or frustrated. Or you222ll be saying, 223Great!224  But are you listening for what will confir
m what you already think? Or are you 
listening in order to discover something new? Th
at is important. It is
 difficult for sleeping 
people. Jesus proclaimed the good news yet he was rejected. Not because it was good, but 
because it was new. We hate the new. We hate
 it! And the sooner we face up to that fact, 
the better. We don222t want new things, particul
arly when they222re disturbing, particularly 
when they involve change. Most particular
ly if it involves saying, 223I was wrong.224 I 
remember meeting an eighty-seven-year-old Jesu
it in Spain; he222d been my professor and 
rector in India thirty or fo
rty years ago. And he attended a workshop like this. 223I should   11  have heard you speak sixty years ago,224 he 
said. 223You know something. I222ve been wrong 
all my life.224 God, to listen to that! It222s like 
looking at one of the wonders of the world. 
That, ladies and gentlemen, is 
faith
! An openness to the truth, no matter what the 
consequences, no matter where it leads you and when you don222t even know where it222s 
going to lead you. That222s faith. 
Not
 belief, but faith. Your beliefs give you a lot of 
security, but faith is insecu
rity. You don222t know. You222re read
y to follow and you222re open, 
you222re wide open! You222re ready to list
en. And, mind you, being open does not mean 
being gullible, it doesn222t mean swallowing what
ever the speaker is saying. Oh no. You222ve 
got to challenge everything I222m saying. But chal
lenge it from an attitude of openness, not 
from an attitude of stubbornness. And challenge it all. Recall thos
e lovely words of 
Buddha when he said, 223Monks and scholars must
 not accept my words out of respect, but 
must analyze them the way a goldsmith 
analyzes gold227by cutting, scraping, rubbing, 
melting.224  When you do that, you222re lis
tening. You222ve taken another major step toward 
awakening. The first step, as I said, was a readiness to admit that you don222t want to wake 
up, that you don222t want to be ha
ppy. There are all kinds of resi
stances to that
 within you. 
The second step is a readiness to understand, to listen, to challe
nge your whole belief 
system. Not just your religious beliefs, your political beliefs, your social beliefs, your 
psychological beliefs, but all of them. A readine
ss to reappraise them all, in the Buddha222s 
metaphor. And I222ll give you plenty 
of opportunity to do that here.      THE MASQUERADE  OF CHARITY    Charity is really self-interest masqueradi
ng under the form of altruism. You say that 
it is very difficult to accept that there may 
be times when you are not honest to goodness 
really trying to be loving 
or trustful. Let me simplify it. Let222s make it as simple as 
possible. Let222s even make it as blunt and extreme as possible, at 
least to begin with. 
There are two types of selfis
hness. The first type is the one where I give myself the 
pleasure of pleasing myself. That222s what we 
generally call self-cen
teredness. The second 
is when I give myself the pleasure of pleasi
ng others. That would be a more refined kind 
of selfishness.  The first one is very obvious, but the sec
ond one is hidden, very hidden, and for that 
reason more dangerous, because we get to feel
 that we222re really great. But maybe we222re 
not all that great after 
all. You protest when I say that. That222s great!  You, madam, you say that, in your case, you 
live alone, and go to the rectory and 
give several hours of your time. But you also 
admit you222re really doing it for a selfish 
reason 227your need to be needed227and you also
 know you need to be needed in a way 
that makes you feel like you222re contributing to 
the world a little bit. But you also claim 
that, because they also need you to
 do this, it222s a two-way street.  You222re almost enlightened! We222ve got to l
earn from you. That222s right. She is saying, 
223I give something, I get something.224 She is ri
ght. I go out to help, 
I give something, I get 
something. That222s beautiful. That222s true. That222s
 real. That isn222t char
ity, that222s enlightened 
self-interest.   12  And you, sir, you point out that the gospel 
of Jesus is ultimatel
y a gospel of self-
interest. We achieve eternal life by our acts of
 charity. 223Come blest of
 my Father, when I 
was hungry, you gave me to eat,224 and so on. Y
ou say that perfectly confirms what I222ve 
said. When we look at Jesus, you say, we see that
 his acts of charity were acts of ultimate 
self-interest, to win souls for eternal life. And you see that as the whole thrust and 
meaning of life: the achievement of
 self-interest by acts of charity.  All right. But you see, you are cheating a 
bit because you brought 
religion into this. 
It222s legitimate. It222s valid. But how would it be 
if I deal with the gospels, with the Bible, 
with Jesus, toward the 
end
 of this retreat. I will say this much now to complicate it even 
more. 223I was hungry, and you gave me to eat, 
I was thirsty and you gave me to drink,224 
and what do they reply? 223When? When di
d we do it? We didn222t know it.224 They were 
unconscious! I sometimes have a horrid fant
asy where the king says, 223I was hungry and 
you gave me to eat,224 and the people on th
e right side say, 223That222s right, Lord, we 
know
.224 
223I wasn222t talking to you,224 th
e king tells them. 223It doesn222t 
follow the script; you222re not 
supposed
 to have known.224 Isn222t that interesting? But 
you
 know. You know the inner 
pleasure you have while doing acts of charity. 
Aha! That222s right! It222s the opposite of 
someone who says, 223What222s so great about wh
at I did? I did some
thing, I got something. 
I had no notion I was doing anything good. My le
ft hand had no idea what my right hand 
was doing.224 You know, a good is never so good 
as when you have no awareness that 
you222re doing good. You are never so good as 
when you have no consciousness that 
you222re good. Or as the great Sufi would say, 223A saint is one until he or she knows it.224 
Unselfconscious! Unselfconscious!  Some of you object to this. Y
ou say, 223Isn222t the pleasure I re
ceive in giving, isn222t that 
eternal life right here and now?224 I wouldn222
t know. I call pleasure, pleasure, and nothing 
more. For the time being, at least until we 
get into religion later on. But I want you to 
understand something right at the begi
nning, that religion is not227I repeat: 
not
227
necessarily connected with spirituality. Please ke
ep religion out of this for the time being.  All right, you ask, what about
 the soldier who falls on a grenade to keep it from 
hurting others? And what about 
the man who got into a truc
k full of dynamite and drove 
into the American camp in Beirut? How about 
him? 223Greater love th
an this no one has.224 
But the Americans don222t think so. He did it de
liberately. He was terrible, wasn222t he? But 
he wouldn222t think so, I assure you. He thought he was going to heaven. 
That222s right. Just 
like your soldier falling on the grenade.  I222m trying to get at a pictur
e of an action where there is not self, where you222re awake 
and what you do is done through you. Your deed
 in that case becomes a happening. 223Let 
it be done to me.224 I222m not excluding that. But when 
you
 do it, I222m searching for the 
selfishness. Even if it is only 223I222ll be remember
ed as a great hero,224 or 223I222d never be able 
to live if I didn222t do th
is. I222d never be able to live with
 the thought if I ran away.224 But 
remember, I222m not excluding the other kind of act.
 I didn222t say that there never is any act 
where there is not self. Maybe there is. We222
ll have to explore that. A mother saving a 
child227saving 
her child, you say. But how come she222s 
not saving the neighbor222s child? 
It222s the 
hers
. It222s the soldier dying for 
his country. Many such deaths bother me. I ask 
myself, 223Are they the result 
of brainwashing?224 Martyrs bot
her me. I think they222re often 
brainwashed. Muslim martyrs, Hindu martyrs, 
Buddhist martyrs, Chri
stian martyrs, they 
are brainwashed!  They222ve got an idea in their 
heads that they must die, that death is a great thing.   13  They feel nothing, they go right in. But not a
ll of them, so listen to me properly. I didn222t 
say all
 of them, but I wouldn222t exclude the 
possibility. Lots of communists get 
brainwashed (you222re ready to believe that). Th
ey222re so brainwashed they222re ready to die. I 
sometimes say to myself that the process 
that we use for making, for example, a St. 
Francis Xavier could be exactly the same pr
ocess used for produci
ng terrorists. You can 
have a man go on a thirty-day retreat and come 
out all aflame with the love of Christ, yet 
without the slightes
t bit of self-awareness. None. He coul
d be a big pain. He thinks he222s a 
great saint. I don222t mean to slander Francis Xa
vier, who probably was a great saint, but he 
was a difficult man to live with. You know he 
was a lousy superior, he
 really was! Do a 
historical investigation. Ignati
us always had to step in to undo the harm that this good 
man was doing by his intolerance. You need to 
be pretty intolerant 
to achieve what he 
achieved. Go, go, go, go227no matter how many corpse
s fall by the wayside. Some critics 
of Francis Xavier claim exactly that. He used to dismiss men from 
our Society and they222d 
appeal to Ignatius, who would 
say, 223Come to Rome and we222ll 
talk about it.224 And Ignatius 
surreptitiously got them in again. How much se
lf-awareness was there in this situation? 
Who are we to judge, we don222t know.  I222m not saying there222s no such thing as pure motivation. I222m saying that ordinarily 
everything we do is in our 
self-interest. Everything. When you do something for the love 
of Christ, is that selfishness? Yes. When
 you222re doing something for the love of anybody, 
it is in your self-interest. 
I222ll have to explain that.  Suppose you happen to live in Phoenix a
nd you feed over five hundred children a 
day. That gives you a good feeling? Well, woul
d you expect it to give you a bad feeling? 
But sometimes it does. And that is because th
ere are some people who do things so that 
they won222t 
have to have a bad feeling
. And they call 
that
 charity. They act out of guilt. 
That isn222t love. But, thank God, you do things
 for people and it222s pleasurable. Wonderful! 
You222re a healthy individual because you222re 
self-interested
. That222s healthy.  Let me summarize what I was saying about
 selfless charity. I sa
id there were two 
types of selfishness; maybe I should have sa
id three. First, when I do something, or 
rather, when I give myself the pleasure of
 pleasing myself; second, 
when I give myself 
the pleasure of pleasing others. Don222t take
 pride in that. Don222t think you222re a great 
person. You222re a very ordinary person, but you222
ve got refined tastes. Your taste is good, 
not the quality of your spirituality. When 
you were a child, you liked Coca-Cola; now 
you222ve grown older and you appreciate chilled b
eer on a hot day. You222ve
 got better tastes 
now. When you were a child, you loved choc
olates; now you222re older, you enjoy a 
symphony, you enjoy a poem. You222ve got better 
tastes. But you222re getting your pleasure 
all the same, except now it222s in the pleasure of pleasing othe
rs. Then you222ve got the third 
type, which is the worst: when you do so
mething good so that you won222t get a bad 
feeling. It doesn222t give you a good feeling to 
do it; it gives you a bad feeling to do it. You 
hate it. You222re making loving sacrifices 
but you222re grumbling. Ha! How little you know 
of yourself if you think you don222t do things this way.  If I had a dollar for every time I did things
 that gave me a bad feeling, I222d be a 
millionaire by now. You know how it goes. 223C
ould I meet you tonight, Father?224 223Yes, 
come on in!224 I don222t want to meet him and I ha
te meeting him. I want to watch that TV 
show tonight, but how do I say no to him? I 
don222t have the guts to say no. 223Come on in,224 
and I222m thinking, 223Oh God, I222ve got to put up with this pain.224  It doesn222t give me a good feeling to m
eet with him and it doesn222t give me a good   14  feeling to say no to him, so I choose the le
sser of the two evils a
nd I say, 223O.K., come on 
in.224 I222m going to be happy when this thing is over and I222ll be able to take my smile off, 
but I start the session with him: 223How are 
you?224 223Wonderful,224 he 
says, and he goes on 
and on about how he loves that workshop, and I222m thinking, 223Oh God, when is he going 
to come to the point?224 Finally he comes to
 the point, and I metaphorically slam him 
against the wall and say, 223Well, any fool c
ould solve that kind of problem,224 and I send 
him out. 223Whew! Got rid of him,224 I say. And th
e next morning at breakfast (because I222m 
feeling I was so rude) I go up to him and sa
y, 223How222s life?224 And he answers, 223Pretty 
good.224 And he adds, 223You know, what you said to
 me last night was a real help. Can I 
meet you today, after lunch?224 Oh God!  That222s the worst kind of charity, when 
you222re doing something so you won222t get a 
bad feeling. You don222t have the guts to say you 
want to be left alone
. You want people to 
think you222re a good priest! When you say, 223I 
don222t like hurting people,224 I say, 223Come off 
it! I don222t believe you.224 I don222t 
believe anyone who says that he or she does not like 
hurting people. We love to hurt people, especially some people. We love it. And when 
someone else is doing the hurting we rejoice in it. But we don222t wa
nt to do the hurting 
ourselves because we222ll
 get hurt! Ah, there it is. If we 
do the hurting, others will have a 
bad opinion of us. They won222t like us, they222
ll talk against us and we don222t like that!      WHAT222S ON YOUR MIND?    Life is a banquet. And the 
tragedy is that most people 
are starving to death. That222s 
what I222m really talking about. There222s a nice 
story about some people who were on a raft 
off the coast of Brazil perishing from thirst
. They had no idea that the water they were 
floating on was fresh water. The river was coming 
out into the sea with such force that it 
went out for a couple of miles, so they had fresh water right there where they were. But 
they had no idea. In the same way, we222re surrounded with joy, with happiness, with love. 
Most people have no idea of this whatso
ever. The reason: They222re brainwashed. The 
reason: They222re hypnotized; th
ey222re asleep. Imagine a st
age magician who hypnotizes 
someone so that the person sees what is not 
there and does not see what is there. That222s 
what it222s all about. Repent 
and accept the good news. Repent! Wake up! Don222t weep for 
your sins. Why weep for sins that you committed when you were asleep? Are you going 
to cry because of what you did in your hypnotized state? Why do you want to identify 
with a person like this? Wake up! Wake 
up! Repent! Put on a new mind. Take on a new 
way of looking at things! For 223the
 kingdom is here!224 It222s the 
rare Christian who takes that 
seriously. I said to you that the first thing you need to do is wa
ke up, to face the fact that 
you don222t like being woken up. You222d much rather
 have all of the things which you were 
hypnotized into believing are so precious to
 you, so important to you, so important for 
your life and your survival. Second, understa
nd. Understand that maybe you222ve got the 
wrong ideas and it is these ideas that are in
fluencing your life and making it the mess that 
it is and keeping you asleep. Ideas about love, ideas about freedom, ideas about 
happiness, and so forth. And it isn222t easy to 
listen to someone who would challenge those 
ideas of yours which have come to be so precious to you.  There have been some interesting studies 
in brainwashing. It has been shown that 
you222re brainwashed when you take on or 223intro
ject224 an idea that isn222t yours, that is   15  someone else222s. And the funny thing is that you222ll
 be ready to die for this idea. Isn222t that 
strange? The first test of whether you222ve
 been brainwashed and have introjected 
convictions and beliefs occurs the moment 
they222re attacked. You feel stunned, you react 
emotionally. That222s a pretty good sign227not in
fallible, but a pretty good sign227that we222re 
dealing with brainwashing. You222re ready to
 die for an idea that never was yours. 
Terrorists or saints (so called) take on an id
ea, swallow it whole, and are ready to die for 
it. It222s not easy to listen, 
especially when you get emotional about an idea. And even 
when you don222t get emotional about it, it222s no
t easy to listen; you
222re always listening 
from your programming, from your conditioning, from your hypnotic state. You 
frequently interpret everything 
that222s being said in terms of your hypnotic state or your 
conditioning or your programm
ing. Like this girl who222s 
listening to a lecture on 
agriculture and says, 223Excuse me, sir, you know 
I agree with you completely that the best 
manure is aged horse manure. Would you tell 
us how old the horse should optimally be?224 
See where she222s coming from? We all have our positions, don222t we? And we listen 
from
 
those positions. 223Henry, how you222ve changed!
 You were so tall and you222ve grown so 
short. You were so well built and you222ve gr
own so thin. You were so fair and you222ve 
become so dark. What happened to you, Henr
y?224 Henry says, 223I222m not Henry. I222m John.224 
223Oh, you changed your name too!224 How do you
 get people like that to listen?  The most difficult thing in the world is to 
listen, to see. We do
n222t want to see. Do 
you think a capitalist wants to see what is 
good in the communist system? Do you think a 
communist wants to see what is good and heal
thy in the capitalist system? Do you think a 
rich man wants to look at poor people? We 
don222t want to look, because if we do, we may 
change. We don222t want to look. If you look, you 
lose control of the 
life that you are so 
precariously holding together. And so in or
der to wake up, the one thing you need the 
most is not energy, or strength, or youthfulne
ss, or even great intelligence. The one thing 
you need most of all is the readiness to le
arn something new. The chances that you will 
wake up are in direct pro
portion to the amount of trut
h you can take without running 
away. How much are you ready to take? How 
much of everything you222ve held dear are 
you ready to have shattered, without runni
ng away? How ready are you to think of 
something unfamiliar?  The first reaction is one of 
fear. It222s not that we fear
 the unknown. You cannot fear 
something that you do not know. Nobody is afra
id of the unknown. What you really fear 
is the loss of the known. That222s what you fear.  By way of an example, I made the point 
that everything we do is tainted with 
selfishness. That isn222t easy to hear. But th
ink now for a minute, let222s go a little deeper 
into that. If everything you do comes from self-interest227enlightened or otherwise227how 
does that make you feel about all your charity
 and all your good deeds? What happens to 
those? Here222s a little exercise for you. 
Think of all the good deeds you222ve done, or of 
some of them (because I222m only giving you 
a few seconds). Now understand that they 
really sprang from self-interest, whether 
you knew it or not. What happens to your pride? 
What happens to your vanity? What happens to that good feeling you gave yourself, that 
pat on the back every time you did something th
at you thought was so charitable? It gets 
flattened out, doesn222t it? What happens to
 that looking down your nose at your neighbor 
who you thought was so selfish? The whole th
ing changes, doesn222t 
it? 223Well,224 you say, 
223my neighbor has coarser tastes than I do.224 
You222re the more dangerous person, you really 
are. Jesus Christ seems to have had less troub
le with the other type
 than with your type.   16  Much less trouble. He ran into trouble with pe
ople who were really convinced they were 
good. Other types didn222t seem to give him much trouble at al
l, the ones who were openly 
selfish and knew it. Can you see how liberating 
that is? Hey, wake up! 
It222s liberating. It222s 
wonderful! Are you feeling depressed? Maybe 
you are. Isn222t it w
onderful to realize 
you222re no better than anybody 
else in this world? Is
n222t it wonderful? Are you 
disappointed? Look what we222ve brought to light! What happens to your vanity? You222d 
like to give yourself a good feeling that 
you222re better than others. But look how we 
brought a fallacy to light!      GOOD, BAD, OR LUCKY    To me, selfishness seems to come out of an
 instinct for self-p
reservation, which is 
our deepest and first instinct. How can we opt
 for selflessness? It would be almost like 
opting for nonbeing. To me, it would seem to 
be the same thing as nonbeing. Whatever it 
is, I222m saying: Stop feeling bad about being 
selfish; we222re all the same. Someone once 
had a terribly beautiful thing to
 say about Jesus. This pers
on wasn222t even Christian. He 
said, 223The lovely thing about Je
sus was that he was so at home with sinners, because he 
understood that he wasn222t one bit better than
 they were.224 We differ from others227from 
criminals, for example227only in what we do or don222t do, 
not in what we are
. The only 
difference between Jesus and those others was 
that he was awake and they weren222t. Look 
at people who win the lottery. Do they say, 223
I222m so proud to accept this prize, not for 
myself, but for my nation and my society.224 Does anybody talk like that when they win 
the lottery? No. Because they were 
lucky, lucky. So they won the lo
ttery, first prize. 
Anything to be proud of in that?  In the same way, if you achieved enlightenme
nt, you would do so in the interest of 
self and you would be lucky. Do you want to glory in that? What222s there to glory about? 
Can222t you see how utterly stupid it is to be
 vain about your good deeds? The Pharisee 
wasn222t an evil man, he was a stupid man. He 
was stupid, not evil. He didn222t stop to think. 
Someone once said, 223I dare not stop to think, because if I 
did, I wouldn222t know how to 
get started again.224      OUR ILLUSION  ABOUT OTHERS    So if you stop to think, you would see that 
there222s nothing to be 
very proud of after 
all. What does this do to your relationship 
with people? What are you complaining about? 
A young man came to complain that his girlfrie
nd had let him down, that she had played 
false. What are you complaining about? Did 
you expect any better? Expect the worst, 
you222re dealing with selfish people. You222re the idiot227you glorified 
her, didn222t you? You 
thought she was a princess, you t
hought people were nice. They
222re not! They222re not nice. 
They222re as bad as you are227bad, you understand
? They222re asleep like you. And what do 
you think they are going to seek
? Their own self-interest, ex
actly like you. No difference.   17  Can you imagine how liberating it is that you222ll never be disillusioned again, never be 
disappointed again? You222ll never feel let down 
again. Never feel rejected. Want to wake 
up? You want happiness? You want freedom? 
Here it is: Drop your false ideas. See 
through people. If you see through yourself
, you will see through everyone. Then you 
will love them. Otherwise you spend the w
hole time grappling with your wrong notions 
of them, with your illusions that are constantly crashing against reality.  It222s probably too startling for many of 
you to understand that everyone except the 
very rare awakened person can be 
expected
 to be selfish and to s
eek his or her own self-
interest whether in coarse or in refined ways
. This leads you to see th
at there222s nothing to 
be disappointed about, nothing 
to be disillusioned about. If
 you had been in touch with 
reality all along, you would neve
r have been disappointed. But you chose to paint people 
in glowing colors; you chose not to see thr
ough human beings because you chose not to 
see through yourself. So you222re paying the price now.  Before we discuss this, let me tell 
you a story. Somebody once asked, 223What is 
enlightenment like? What is awakening lik
e?224 It222s like the tramp in London who was 
settling in for the night. He222d hardly been able
 to get a crust of bread to eat. Then he 
reaches this embankment on the river Thames. 
There was a slight drizzle, so he huddled 
in his old tattered cloak. He
 was about to go to sleep when suddenly a chauffeur-driven 
Rolls-Royce pulls up. Out of the car steps a 
beautiful young lady who says to him, 223My 
poor man, are you planning on spending the nigh
t here on this embankment?224 And the 
tramp says, 223Yes.224 She says, 223I won222t have it. You222re coming to my house and you222re 
going to spend a comfortable night and you222re
 going to get a good dinner.224 She insists on 
his getting into the car. Well, they ride 
out of London and get to a place where she has a 
sprawling mansion with large grounds. They ar
e ushered in by the butler, to whom she 
says, 223James, please make sure he222s put in 
the servants222 quarters and treated well.224 Which 
is what James does. The young lady had undresse
d and was about to go to bed when she 
suddenly remembers her guest for the night. So
 she slips something 
on and pads along the 
corridor to the servants222 quarters. She sees a 
little chink of light from the room where the 
tramp was put up. She taps lightly at the door
, opens it, and finds the man awake. She 
says, 223What222s the trouble, my good man, didn222t you get a good meal?224 He said, 223Never 
had a better meal in my life, lady.224 223Are 
you warm enough?224 He says, 223Yes, lovely warm 
bed.224 Then she says, 223Maybe you need a little company. Why don222t you move over a, 
bit.224 And she comes closer to him and he moves over and falls right into the Thames.  Ha! You didn222t expect that one! Enlight
enment! Enlightenment! Wake up. When 
you222re ready to exchange your illusions for 
reality, when you222re ready to exchange your 
dreams for facts, that222s the way you find it all. That222s where life finally becomes 
meaningful. Life becomes beautiful.  There222s a story about Ramirez. He is old 
and living up there in his castle on a hill. 
He looks out the window (he222s in bed and paraly
zed) and he sees his enemy. Old as he is, 
leaning on a cane, his enemy is climbing up 
the hill227slowly, painfully. It takes him 
about two and a half hours to 
get up the hill. There222s noth
ing Ramirez can do because the 
servants have the day off. So his enemy ope
ns the door, comes straight to the bedroom, 
puts his hand inside his cloak, and pulls out
 a gun. He says, 223At last, Ramirez, we222re 
going to settle scores!224 Ramirez tries his level 
best to talk him out of it. He says, 223Come 
on, Borgia, you can222t do that. 
You know I222m no longer the 
man who ill-treated you as 
that youngster years ago, and you222re no longe
r that youngster. Come off it!224 223Oh no,224   18  says his enemy, 223your sweet words aren222t going to deter me from this divine mission of 
mine. It222s revenge I want and there222s not
hing you can do about it.224 And Ramirez says, 
223But there is!224 223What?224 asks 
his enemy. 223I can wake up,224 says
 Ramirez. And he did; he 
woke up! That222s what enlightenment is like. When someone tells you, 223There is nothing 
you can do about it,224 you say, 223The
re is, I can wake up!224 All of a sudden, life is no longer 
the nightmare that it has seemed. Wake up!  Somebody came up to me with a question. What do you think the question was? He 
asked me, 223Are you enlightened?224 What do 
you think my answer was? What does it 
matter!  You want a better answer? My answer 
would be: 223How would I know? How would 
you know? What does it matter?224 You know some
thing? If you want anything too badly, 
you222re in big trouble. You know something el
se? If I were enlight
ened and you listened 
to me because I was enlightened, then you
222re in big trouble. Are you ready to be 
brainwashed by someone who222s enlightened? You can be brainwashed by anybody, you 
know. What does it matter whether someone222s en
lightened or not? But see, we want to 
lean on someone, don222t we? We want to lean
 on anybody we think has arrived. We love 
to hear that people have arri
ved. It gives us hope, doesn222t 
it? What do you want to hope 
for? Isn222t that another form of desire?  You want to hope for something better than what you have right now, don222t you? 
Otherwise you wouldn222t be hoping. But then, yo
u forget that you have it all right now 
anyway, and you don222t know it. Why not con
centrate on the now instead of hoping for 
better times in the future? Why not understand 
the now instead of fo
rgetting it and hoping 
for the future? Isn222t the future just another trap?      SELF-OBSERVATION    The only way someone can be of help to you is in challenging your ideas. If you222re 
ready to listen and if you222re r
eady to be challenged, there222
s one thing that you can do, but 
no one can help you
. What is this most important thing 
of all? It222s calle
d self-observation. 
No one can help you there. No one can give you a method. No one can show you a 
technique. The moment you pick up a tech
nique, you222re programmed again. But self-
observation227watching yourself227is 
important. It is not the same
 as self-absorption. Self-
absorption is self-preoccupation, where you222re concerned about yourself, worried about 
yourself. I222m talking about 
self-observation
. What222s that? It means to watch everything in 
you and around you as far as possible and watc
h it as if it were happening to someone 
else. What does that last sentence mean? 
It means that you do not personalize what is 
happening to you. It means that you look at th
ings as if you have no connection with 
them whatsoever.  The reason you suffer from your depression a
nd your anxieties is that you identify 
with them. You say, 223I222m depressed.224 But th
at is false. You are not depressed. If you 
want to be accurate, you might say, 223I am
 experiencing a depre
ssion right now.224 But you 
can hardly say, 223I am depressed.224 You are not
 your depression. That is but a strange kind 
of trick of the mind, a strange kind of illusion. You have deluded yourself into thinking227
though you are not aware of it227that you 
are
 your depression, that you 
are
 your anxiety, 
that you 
are
 your joy or the thrills th
at you have. 223I am delighted!224 You certainly are not   19  delighted. Delight may be 
in
 you right now, but wait around, it will change; it won222t last: 
it never lasts; it keeps changi
ng: it222s always changing. Clouds 
come and go: some of them 
are black and some white, some of them are larg
e, others small. If we want to follow the 
analogy, you would be the sky, observing th
e clouds. You are a passive, detached 
observer. That222s shocking, particularly
 to someone in the Western culture.  You222re not interfering. Don222t interfere. 
Don222t 223fix224 anything. Watch! Observe!  The trouble with people is that they222re busy fixing things they don222t even 
understand. We222re always fixing th
ings, aren222t we? It never st
rikes us that things don222t 
need to be fixed. They really don222t. This is a great illumination. They need to be 
understood. If you understood them, they222d change.      Awareness Without Evaluating Everything    Do you want to change the world? How 
about beginning with yourself? How about 
being transformed yourself first? But how
 do you achieve that? Through observation. 
Through understanding. With no interference or judgment on your part. Because what 
you judge you cannot understand.  When you say of someone, 223He222s a communi
st,224 understanding has stopped at that 
moment. You slapped a label on him. 223She222s
 a capitalist.224 Understa
nding has stopped at 
that moment. You slapped a label on her, and 
if the label carries 
undertones of approval 
or disapproval, so much the worse! How are you going to understand what you 
disapprove of, or what you appr
ove of, for that matter? All 
of this sounds like a new 
world, doesn222t it? No judgment, no commentar
y, no attitude: one simply observes, one 
studies, one watches, without 
the desire to change what 
is. Because if you desire to 
change what is into what you think 
should be
, you no longer understand. A dog trainer 
attempts to understand a dog so that he can 
train the dog to perform certain tricks. A 
scientist observes the behavior of ants with no further end in view than to study ants, to 
learn as much as possible about them. He ha
s no other aim. He222s not attempting to train 
them or get anything out of them. He222s interest
ed in ants, he wants to learn as much as 
possible about them. That222s hi
s attitude. The day you attain 
a posture like that, you will 
experience a miracle. You will change227effortlessly, correctly. Change will happen, you 
will not have to bring it about. As the life of
 awareness settles on your darkness, whatever 
is evil will disappear. Whatever is good will be
 fostered. You will have to experience that 
for yourself.  But this calls for a disciplined mind. And when I say disciplined, I222m not talking 
about effort. I222m talking about something else
. Have you ever studied an athlete. His or 
her whole life is sports, but what a disciplined 
life he or she leads. And look at a river as 
it moves toward the sea. It creates its own ba
nks that contain it. When there222s something 
within you that moves in the right directi
on, it creates its own discipline. The moment 
you get bitten by the bug of awar
eness. Oh, it222s so delightful! It222s the most delightful 
thing in the world; the most important, the mo
st delightful. There222s nothing so important 
in the world as awakening. Nothing! And, of 
course, it is also disc
ipline in its own way.  There222s nothing so delightful as being aw
are. Would you rather live in darkness? 
Would you rather act and not be aware of your
 actions, talk and not be aware of your 
words? Would you rather listen to people and not
 be aware of what you222re hearing, or see   20  things and not be aware of what you222re l
ooking at? The great So
crates said, 223The 
unaware life is not worth living.224 That222s a self-evident truth. 
Most people don222t live 
aware lives. They live mechanical live
s, mechanical thoughts227generally somebody 
else222s227mechanical emotions, mechanical acti
ons, mechanical reactions. Do you want to 
see how mechanical you really are? 223My, that
222s a lovely shirt you222re wearing.224 You feel 
good hearing that. For a shirt, for heaven222s
 sake! You feel proud 
of yourself when you 
hear that. People come over to my center in 
India and they say, 223What a lovely place, 
these lovely trees224 (for which I222m not respons
ible at all), 223this 
lovely climate.224 And 
already I222m feeling good, un
til I catch myself 
feeling good, and I say, 223Hey, can you 
imagine anything as stupid as that?224 I222m not responsible for those trees; I wasn222t 
responsible for choosing the location. I didn222t order the weather; it just happened. But 
223me224 got in there, so I222m feeling good. I222m
 feeling good about 223my224 culture and 223my224 
nation. How stupid can you get? I mean that
. I222m told my great Indian culture has 
produced all these mystics. I didn222t produce th
em. I222m not responsible for them. Or they 
tell me, 223That country of yours and its povert
y227it222s disgusting.224 I feel ashamed. But I 
didn222t create it. What222s going on? Did you ever stop to th
ink? People tell you, 223I think 
you222re very charming,224 so I feel wonderful. I 
get a positive stroke (t
hat222s why they call it 
I222m O.K., you222re O.K.). I222m going to write a book someday and the title will be 
I222m an 
Ass, You222re an Ass
. That222s the most liberating, wonderf
ul thing in the world, when you 
openly admit you222re an ass. It222s wonderful
. When people tell me, 223You222re wrong.224 I say, 
223What can you expect of an ass?224  Disarmed, everybody has to be disarmed. In 
the final liberation, I222m an ass, you222re 
an ass. Normally the way it goes, I press 
a button and you222re up; 
I press another button 
and you222re down. And you like that. How 
many people do you know who are unaffected 
by praise or blame? That isn222t human, we sa
y. Human means that you have to be a little 
monkey, so everybody can twist your tail, and you do whatever you 
ought
 to be doing. 
But is that human? If you find me char
ming, it means that right now you222re in a good 
mood, nothing more.  It also means that I fit your shopping lis
t. We all carry a shopping list around, and 
it222s as though you222ve got to measure up to 
this list227tall, um, dark, um, handsome, 
according to 
my
 tastes. 223I like the sound of his voice.224 
You say, 223I222m in love.224 You222re not 
in love, you silly ass. Any time you222re in l
ove227I hesitate to say this227you222re being 
particularly asinine. Sit down and watch 
what222s happening to you. You222re running away 
from yourself. You want to escape. So
mebody once said, 223Thank God for reality, and for 
the means to escape from it.224 So that222s what222s going on. We are so mechanical, so 
controlled. We write books about being cont
rolled and how wonderful it is to be 
controlled and how necessary it
 is that people tell you you
222re O.K. Then you222ll have a 
good feeling about yourself. How wo
nderful it is to be in pris
on! Or as somebody said to 
me yesterday, to be in your cage. Do you like being in prison? Do you like being 
controlled? Let me tell you something: If 
you ever let yourself feel good when people tell 
you that you222re O.K., you are preparing yourself 
to feel bad when they tell you you222re not 
good. As long as you live to fulfill other peop
le222s expectations, you better watch what 
you wear, how you comb your hair, whether you
r shoes are polished227in short, whether 
you live up to every damned expectation of theirs. Do you call that human?  This is what you222ll discover when you observe yourself! You222
ll be horrified! The 
fact of the matter is that you222re neither O.K. nor not O.K. You may fit the current mood   21  or trend or fashion! Does that mean you222
ve become O.K.? Does your O.K.-ness depend 
on that? Does it depend on what people think of
 you? Jesus Christ must have been pretty 
223not O.K.224 by those standards. You222re not O.K. and you222re not not O.K., you222re you. I 
hope that is going to be the bi
g discovery, at least for some 
of you. If three or four of you 
make this discovery during these days we spend together, my, what a wonderful thing! 
Extraordinary! Cut out all the O.K. stuff and 
the not-O.K. stuff; cut out all the judgments 
and simply observe, watch. You222ll make great 
discoveries. These disc
overies will change 
you. You won222t have to make the 
slightest effort, believe me.  This reminds me of this fellow in London af
ter the war. He222s sitting with a parcel 
wrapped in brown paper in hi
s lap; it222s a big, heavy object. The bus conductor comes up 
to him and says, 223What do you have on your la
p there?224 And the man says, 223This is an 
unexploded bomb. We dug it out of the garden
 and I222m taking it to the police station.224 
The conductor says, 223You don222t want to carry
 that on your lap. Put it under the seat.224  Psychology and spirituality (as we generall
y understand it) transf
er the bomb from 
your lap to under your seat. Th
ey don222t really solve your problems. They exchange your 
problems for other problems. Has that ev
er struck you? You had a problem, now you 
exchange it for another one. It222s always going to be that way until we solve the problem 
called 223you.224      THE ILLUSION OF  REWARDS    Until then, we222re going to get nowhere. The 
great mystics and masters in the East 
will say, 223Who are you?224 Many think the most important question in the world is: 223Who 
is Jesus Christ?224 Wrong!  Many think it is: 223Does God exist?224 Wrong! 
Many think it is: 223I
s there a life after 
death?224 Wrong! Nobody seems to be grappling with the problem of: Is there a life 
before
 
death? Yet my experience is that it222s precisely the ones w
ho don222t know what to do with 
this
 life who are all hot and bothered about what they are going to do with 
another life. 
One sign that you222re awakened is that you 
don222t give a damn about what222s going to 
happen in the next life. You222re not both
ered about it; you don222
t care. You are not 
interested, period.  Do you know what eternal life is? You thi
nk it222s everlasting life. But your own 
theologians will tell you that that is crazy, because everlasting is still within time. It is 
time perduring forever. Eternal means 
timeless227no time. The human mind cannot 
understand that. The human mind can understand time and can deny time. What is 
timeless is beyond our comprehension. Yet the mys
tics tell us that eternity is right now. 
How222s that for good news? It is
 right now. People are so dist
ressed when I tell them to 
forget their past. They are so proud of their 
past. Or they are so 
ashamed of their past. 
They222re crazy! Just drop it! When you hear 223R
epent for your past,224 
realize it222s a great 
religious distraction from wa
king up. Wake up! That222s what repent means. Not 223weep for 
your sins.224 Wake up! Understand, stop 
all the crying. Understand! Wake up!       22  FINDING YOURSELF    The great masters tell us that the most im
portant question in the world is: 223Who am 
I?224 Or rather: 223What is 221I222?224 What is this thing I call 223I224? What is this thing I call self? 
You mean you understood everyt
hing else in the world a
nd you didn222t understand this? 
You mean you understood astronomy and black
 holes and quasars and you picked up 
computer science, and you don222t know who you 
are? My, you are still asleep. You are a 
sleeping scientist. You mean you understood what Jesus Christ is and you don222t know 
who you are? How do you know that you have 
understood Jesus Christ? Who is the 
person doing the understanding? Find that out 
first. That222s the foundation of everything, 
isn222t it? It222s because we haven222t understood th
is that we222ve got all these stupid religious 
people involved in all thes
e stupid religious wars227Muslims fighting against Jews, 
Protestants fighting Catholics, and all the re
st of that rubbish. They don222t know who they 
are, because if they did, there wouldn222t be wa
rs. Like the little girl who says to a little 
boy, 223Are you a Presbyterian?224 And he says, 223No, we belong to another abomination!224  But what I222d like to stress right now is se
lf-observation. You are 
listening to me, but 
are you picking up any other sounds besides th
e sound of my voice as
 you listen to me? 
Are you aware of 
your
 reactions as you listen to me? 
If you aren222t, you222re going to be 
brainwashed. Or else you are going to be 
influenced by forces within you of which you 
have no awareness at all. And even if you
222re aware of how you react to me, are you 
simultaneously aware of where your reaction is coming from? Maybe you are not 
listening to me at all; maybe your daddy is list
ening to me. Do you think that222s possible? 
Of course it is. Again and again in my ther
apy groups I come across people who aren222t 
there at all. Their daddy is ther
e, their mommy is there, but 
they222re not there. They never 
were there. 223I live now, not I, but my daddy liv
es in me.224 Well, that222s
 absolutely, literally 
true. I could take you apart piece by piece and 
ask, 223Now, this sentence, does it come 
from Daddy, Mommy, Grandma, Grandpa, whom?224  Who222s living in you? It222s pretty horrifyi
ng when you come to know that. You think 
you are free, but there probably isn222t a gesture,
 a thought, an emotion, an attitude, a belief 
in you that isn222t coming from someone else
. Isn222t that horrible?
 And you don222t know it. 
Talk about a mechanical life that was stam
ped into you. You feel pretty strongly about 
certain things, and you think 
it is you who are feeling str
ongly about them, but are you 
really? It222s going to take a 
lot of awareness for you to unde
rstand that perhaps this thing 
you call 223I224 is simply a conglomeration of your past experiences, of your conditioning 
and programming.  That222s painful. In fact, when you222re be
ginning to awaken, you experience a great 
deal of pain. It222s painful to see your illusi
ons being shattered. Ever
ything that you thought 
you had built up crumbles and that222s painful. 
That222s what repentance is all about; that222s 
what waking up is all about. So how about ta
king a minute, right where you222re sitting 
now, to be aware, even as I talk, of what you222re feeling in your body, and what222s going 
on in your mind, and what your emotional stat
e is like? How about being aware of the 
blackboard, if your eyes are ope
n, and the color of these walls
 and the material they222re 
made of? How about being aware of my face 
and the reaction you have to this face of 
mine? Because you have a reaction whether you
222re aware of it or no
t. And it probably 
isn222t your reaction, but one you were conditione
d to have. And how about being aware of 
some of the things I just said, although that 
wouldn222t be awareness, because that222s just   23  memory now.  Be aware of your presence in this room. Say to yourself, 223I222m 
in this room.224 It222s as if 
you were outside yourself looking 
at yourself. Notice a slightly 
different feeling than if 
you were looking at things in 
the room. Later we222ll ask, 223Who
 is this person who is doing 
the looking?224 I am looking at me. What222s an
 223I224? What222s 223me224? For the time being it222s 
enough that I watch me, but if you find your
self condemning yourself or approving 
yourself, don222t stop the condemnation and don222
t stop the judgment 
or approval, just 
watch it. I222m condemning me; I222m
 disapproving of me
; I222m approving of me. Just look at 
it, period. Don222t try to change it! Don222t say, 223Oh, we were told not to do this.224 Just 
observe what222s going on. As I said to you before, self-observation means watching227
observing whatever is going on in you and ar
ound you as if it were happening to someone 
else.      STRIPPING DOWN  TO THE 223I224    I suggest another exercise now. Would you 
write down on a piece of paper any brief 
way you would describe yourse
lf227for example, businessman, priest, human being, 
Catholic, Jew, anything.  Some write, I notice, things 
like, fruitful, searching pilgrim, competent, alive, 
impatient, centered, flexible, reconciler, 
lover, member of the human race, overly 
structured. This is the fruit, I trust, of observing yourself. As if you were watching 
another person.  But notice, you222ve got 223I224 observing 223me.224 
This is an interesting phenomenon that 
has never ceased to cause wonder to philosophe
rs, mystics, scientists, psychologists, that 
the 223I224 can observe 223me.224 It would seem that 
animals are not able to do this at all. It 
would seem that one needs a certain amount of 
intelligence to be able to do this. What 
I222m going to give you now is not metaphysics; 
it is not philosophy. It is plain observation 
and common sense. The great mystics of the East
 are really referring to that 223I,224 not to 
the 223me.224 As a matter of fact, some of these my
stics tell us that we begin first with things, 
with an awareness of things
; then we move on to an aw
areness of thoughts (that222s the 
223me224); and finally we get to awareness of th
e thinker. Things, thoughts, thinker. What 
we222re really searching for is 
the thinker. Can the thinker know himself? Can I know what 
223I224 is? Some of these mystics reply, 223Can the 
knife cut itself? Can the tooth bite itself? 
Can the eye see itself? Can the 221I222 know its
elf?224 But I am concerned with something 
infinitely more practical right now, and 
that is with deciding what the 223I224 is 
not
. I222ll go as 
slowly as possible because the consequen
ces are devastating. Te
rrific or terrifying, 
depending on your point of view.  Listen to this: Am I my thoughts, the 
thoughts that I am thinking? No. Thoughts 
come and go; I am not my thoughts. Am I my body? They tell us that millions of cells in 
our body are changed or are rene
wed every minute, so that by the end of seven years we 
don222t have a single living cell in
 our body that was there seven years before. Cells come 
and go. Cells arise and die. But 223I224 seems to persist. So am I my body? Evidently not!  223I224 is something other and more than the body. You might say the body is part of   24  223I,224 but it is a changing part
. It keeps moving, it keeps chan
ging. We have the same name 
for it but it constantly changes. Just as we
 have the same name for Niagara Falls, but 
Niagara Falls is constituted by 
water that is constantly ch
anging. We use the same name 
for an ever-changing reality.  How about my name? Is 223I224 my name? Evidently not, because I can change my 
name without changing the 223I.224 How about my
 career? How about my beliefs? I say I am 
a Catholic, a Jew227is that an essential part 
of 223I224? When I move from one religion to 
another, has the 223I224 changed? Do I have a new 
223I224 or is it the same 223I224 that has changed? 
In other words, is my name an essential part 
of me, of the 223I224? Is 
my religion an essential 
part of the 223I224? I mentioned the little girl
 who says to the boy, 223Are you a Presbyterian?224 
Well, somebody told me another story, about
 Paddy. Paddy was walking down the street 
in Belfast and he discovers a gun pressing agai
nst the back of his head and a voice says, 
223Are you Catholic or Protestant?224 Well, Paddy has to do some pretty fast thinking. He 
says, 223I222m a Jew.224 And he hears a voice say, 223
I222ve got to be the luckiest Arab in the 
whole of Belfast.224 Labels are 
so important to us. 223I am a 
Republican,224 we say. But are 
you really? You can222t mean that
 when you switch parties you ha
ve a new 223I.224 Isn222t it the 
same old 223I224 with new political convictions
? I remember hearing 
about a man who asks 
his friend, 223Are you planning to vote Republican
?224 The friend says, 223No, I222m planning to 
vote Democratic. My father was a Democrat
, my grandfather was a Democrat, and my 
great-grandfather was a Democrat.224 The man sa
ys, 223That is crazy logic. I mean, if your 
father was a horse thief, and your grandf
ather was a horse thief, and your great-
grandfather was a horse thief, what would 
you be?224 223Ah,224 the friend answered, 223then I222d 
be a Republican.224  We spend so much of our liv
es reacting to labels, our ow
n and others222. We identify 
the labels with the 223I.224 Catholic and Protes
tant are frequent labels. There was a man who 
went to the priest and said, 223Father, I want
 you to say a Mass for my dog.224 The priest was 
indignant. 223What do you mean, say a Mass for 
your dog?224 223It222s my pet dog,224 said the 
man. 223I loved that dog and I222d like you to 
offer a Mass for him.224 The priest said, 223We 
don222t offer Masses for dogs here. You might 
try the denomination down the street. Ask 
them if they might have a service for you.224 As the man was leaving, he said to the priest, 
223Too bad. I really loved that dog. I was planni
ng to offer a million-dollar stipend for the 
Mass.224 And the priest said, 223Wait a minute,
 you never told me your dog was Catholic.224  When you222re caught up in labels, what value do 
these labels have, as far as the 223I224 is 
concerned? Could we say that 223I
224 is none of the labels we attach to it? Labels belong to 
223me.224 What constantly changes is 223me.224 Does
 223I224 ever change? Does the observer ever 
change? The fact is that no matter what labels
 you think of (except perhaps human being) 
you should apply them to 223me .224 223I224 is none of these things. So when you step out of 
yourself and observe 223me,224 you no longer identi
fy with 223me.224 Suffering exists in 223me,224 
so when you identify 223I224 with 223me,224 suffering begins.  Say that you are afraid or desir
ous or anxious. When 223I224 does not 
identify
 with 
money, or name, or nationality, or persons, or
 friends, or any quality, the 223I224 is never 
threatened. It can be very active, but it isn222t 
threatened. Think of a
nything that caused or 
is causing you pain or worry or anxiety. Fi
rst, can you pick up the desire under that 
suffering, that there222s something you desire
 very keenly or else you wouldn222t be 
suffering. What is that de
sire? Second, it isn222t simply a desire; there222s an 
identification
 
there. You have somehow said to yourself, 223T
he well-being of 221I,222 almost the existence of   25  221I,222 is tied up with this desire.224 All suffe
ring is caused by my identifying myself with 
something, whether that something is
 within me or outside of me.      NEGATIVE FEELINGS  TOWARD OTHERS    At one of my conferences, some
one made the following observation:  223I want to share with you something wonderful that happened to me. I went to the 
movies and I was working shor
tly after that and I was real
ly having trouble with three 
people in my life. So I said, 221All right, ju
st like I learned at th
e movies, I222m going to 
come outside myself.222 For a couple of hours, 
I got in touch with my feelings, with how 
badly I felt toward these three people. I sai
d, 221I really hate those 
people.222 Then I said, 
221Jesus, what can you do about all that?222 A l
ittle while later I be
gan to cry, because I 
realized that Jesus died for those very pe
ople and they couldn222t help how they were, 
anyway. That afternoon I had to go to the offi
ce, where I spoke to those people. I told 
them what my problem was and they agreed w
ith me. I wasn222t mad at them and I didn222t 
hate them anymore.224  Anytime you have a negative feeling toward anyone, you222re living in an illusion. 
There222s something seriously wrong with you. Y
ou222re not seeing realit
y. Something inside 
of you has to change. But what do we generally
 do when we have a negative feeling? 223He 
is to blame, she is to blame. She222s got to 
change.224 No! The world222s all right. The one who 
has to change is you
.  One of you told of working in an institu
tion. During a staff meeting someone would 
inevitably say, 223The food stinks around here
,224 and the regular di
etitian would go into 
orbit. She has identified with the food. She is saying, 223Anyone who attacks the food 
attacks me; I feel threatened.224
 But the 223I224 is never threatened; it222s only the 223me224 that is 
threatened.  But suppose you witness some out-and-out inju
stice, something that is obviously 
and objectively wrong. Would it not
 be a proper reaction to 
say this should not be 
happening? Should you somehow want
 to involve yourself in co
rrecting a situation that222s 
wrong? Someone222s injuring a child and you see abuse going on. How about that kind of 
thing? I hope you did not assume that I was 
saying you shouldn222t do anything. I said that 
if you didn222t have negative feelings you222d be much more effective, 
much
 more effective. 
Because when negative feelings come in, you 
go blind. 223Me224 steps into the picture, and 
everything gets fouled up. Where we had one
 problem on our hands before, now we have 
two problems. Many wrongly assume that not 
having negative feelings like anger and 
resentment and hate means that you do nothi
ng about a situation. Oh no, oh no! You are 
not affected emotionally but you spring into action. You become very sensitive to things 
and people around you. What kills the sensitiv
ity is what many people would call the 
conditioned self: when you so identify with 223m
e224 that there222s too much of 223me224 in it for 
you to see things objectively, with detachment
. It222s very important that when you swing 
into action, you be able to s
ee things with detachment. Bu
t negative emotions prevent 
that.  What, then, would we call the kind of passion 
that motivates or activates energy into   26  doing something about objective evil
s? Whatever it is, it is not a 
reaction
; it is action.  Some of you wonder if there is a gr
ay area before something becomes an 
attachment, before identification sets in. Say 
a friend dies. It seems right and very human 
to feel some sadness about that. But what
 reaction? Self-pity
? What would you be 
grieving about? Think about that. What I222m sa
ying is going to sound 
terrible to you, but I 
told you, I222m coming from anot
her world. Your reaction is 
personal
 loss, right? Feeling 
sorry for 223me224 or for other people your friend 
might have brought joy to. But that means 
you222re feeling sorry for other pe
ople who are feeling sorry for themselves. If they222re not 
feeling sorry for themselves, what would they 
be feeling sorry for? We never feel grief 
when we lose something that we have allowed 
to be free, that we have never attempted to 
possess. Grief is a sign that I made my happi
ness depend on this thing or person, at least 
to some extent. We222re so accustomed to hear
 the opposite of this that what I say sounds 
inhuman, doesn222t it?      ON DEPENDENCE    But it222s what all the mystics in the past ha
ve been telling us. I222m not saying that 
223me,224 the conditioned-self, will not sometimes fall into its usual patterns. That222s the way 
we222ve been conditioned. But it raises the questio
n whether it is conceivable to live a life 
in which you would be so totally alone that you would depend on no one.  We all depend on one another for all kinds of things, don222t we? We depend on the 
butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker. 
Interdependence. That222s fine! We set up 
society this way and we allot 
different functions to differe
nt people for the welfare of 
everyone, so that we will function better a
nd live more effectively227at least we hope so. 
But to depend on another psychologically
227to depend on another emotionally227what 
does that imply? It means to depend on 
another human being for my happiness.  Think about that. Because if you do, the next thing you will be doing, whether 
you222re aware of it or not, is 
demanding that other people contribute to your happiness. 
Then there will be a next step227f
ear, fear of loss, fear of 
alienation, fear of rejection, 
mutual control. Perfect love 
casts out fear. Where there is
 love there are no demands, no 
expectations, no dependency. I do not demand 
that you make me happy; my happiness 
does not lie in you. If you were to leave me, I 
will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your 
company immensely, but I do not cling.  I enjoy it on a nonclinging basis. What I really
 enjoy is not you; it222s something that222s 
greater than both you and me. It is someth
ing that I discovered, a kind of symphony, a 
kind of orchestra that plays one melody in
 your presence, but when you depart, the 
orchestra doesn222t stop. When I meet someone 
else, it plays another melody, which is also 
very delightful. And when I222m alone, it continue
s to play. There222s a great repertoire and it 
never ceases to play.  That222s what awakening is all about. That
222s also why we222re hypnotized, brainwashed, 
asleep. It seems terrifying to ask, but can you be
 said to love me if
 you cling to me and 
will not let me go? If you will not
 let me be? Can you be said to love me if you need me 
psychologically or emotionally for your happine
ss? This flies in the face of the universal 
teaching of all the scriptures, of
 all religions, of all the mystics. 223How is it that we missed 
it for so many years?224 I say to myself repeat
edly. 223How come I di
dn222t see it?224 When you   27  read those radical things in 
the scriptures, you begin to wonder: Is this man crazy? But 
after a while you begin to think everybody else 
is crazy. 223Unless you hate your father and 
mother, brothers and sisters, unless you 
renounce and give up everything you possess, 
you cannot be my disciple.224 You must dr
op it all. Not physical renunciation, you 
understand; that222s easy. When your illusions drop, 
you222re in touch with reality at last, and 
believe me, you will never again be lonel
y, never again. Loneliness is not cured by 
human company. Loneliness is cured by contact with reality. Oh, I have so much to say 
about that. Contact with reality, dropping one222s illusions, making contact with the real. 
Whatever it is, it has no name. We can onl
y know it by dropping what is unreal. You can 
only know what aloneness is when you 
drop your clinging, when you drop your 
dependency. But the first step toward that is 
that you see it as desi
rable. If you don222t see it 
as desirable, how will you get anywhere near it?  Think of the loneliness that is yours. Would human compa
ny ever take it away? It 
will only serve as a distraction. There222s an em
ptiness inside, isn222t there? And when the 
emptiness surfaces, what do you do? You run away, turn on the television, turn on the 
radio, read a book, search for human company, 
seek entertainment, seek distraction. 
Everybody does that. It222s big business nowadays, an organized industry 
to distract us and 
entertain us.        HOW HAPPINESS HAPPENS    Come home to yourself. Observe yourself. 
That222s why I said 
earlier that self-
observation is such a delightful and extraord
inary thing. After a while you don222t have to 
make any effort, because, as illusions begin 
to crumble, you begin to know things that 
cannot be described. It222s called happiness. 
Everything changes and you become addicted 
to awareness.  There222s the story of the disc
iple who went to the mast
er and said, 223Could you give 
me a word of wisdom? Coul
d you tell me something that would guide me through my 
days?224 It was the master222s day of silence, 
so he picked up a pad. It said, 223Awareness.224 
When the disciple saw it, he said, 223This is 
too brief. Can you expand on it a bit?224 So the 
master took back the pad and wrote, 223Aware
ness, awareness, awar
eness.224 The disciple 
said, 223Yes, but what does it mean?224 The master took back the pad and wrote, 
223Awareness, awareness, awareness means227awareness.224  That222s what it is to watch yourself. No 
one can show you how to do it, because he 
would be giving you a technique, he woul
d be programming you. But watch yourself. 
When you talk to someone, are you aware of 
it or are you simply 
identifying with it? 
When you got angry with somebody, were you aw
are that you were angry or were you 
simply identifying with your anger? Late
r, when you had the time, did you study your 
experience and attempt to understand it? Wher
e did it come from? What brought it on? I 
don222t know of any other way to awareness. You only change what you understand. What 
you do not understand and are not aware of, 
you repress. You don222t change. But when 
you understand it, it changes.  I am sometimes asked, 223Is this growing in awareness a gradual thing, or is it a 
221whammo222 kind of thing?224 There 
are some lucky people who see this in a flash. They just 
become aware. There are others who k
eep growing into it, slowly, gradually,   28  increasingly. They begin to see things. Illu
sions drop away, fantasies are peeled away, 
and they start to get in touch with facts. Th
ere222s no general rule. There222s a famous story 
about the lion who came upon a flock of sheep and to his amazement found a lion among 
the sheep. It was a lion who had been brought up 
by the sheep ever since he was a cub. It 
would bleat like a sheep and run around like a 
sheep. The lion went straight for him, and 
when the sheep-lion stood in front of the real
 one, he trembled in every limb. And the 
lion said to him, 223What are you doing among 
these sheep?224 And the sheep-lion said, 223I 
am a sheep.224 And the lion said, 223Oh no you222re not. You222re coming with me.224 So he took 
the sheep-lion to a pool and said, 223Look!224 
And when the sheep-lion looked at his 
reflection in the water, he let out a mighty ro
ar, and in that moment he was transformed. 
He was never the same again.  If you222re lucky and the gods are gracious or if you are gifted with divine grace (use 
any theological expression you want), you might suddenly understand who 223I224 is, and 
you222ll never be the same again, never. Nothing 
will ever be able to touch you again and 
no one will ever be able to hurt you again.  You will fear no one and you will fear nothi
ng. Isn222t that extraordinary? You222ll live 
like a king, like a queen. This is what it 
means to live like royalty. Not rubbish like 
getting your picture in the news
papers or having a lot of mone
y. That222s a lot of rot. You 
fear no one because you222re perfectly conten
t to be nobody. You don222t give a damn about 
success or failure. They mean nothing. Honor, 
disgrace, they mean nothing! If you make 
a fool of yourself, that mean
s nothing either. Isn222t that a wo
nderful state to be in! Some 
people arrive at this goal painstakingly, step
 by step, through months and weeks of self-
awareness. But I222ll promise you this: I have
 not known a single person who gave time to 
being aware who didn222t see a di
fference in a matter of weeks.
 The quality of their life 
changes, so they don222t have to take it on fa
ith anymore. They see it; they222re different. 
They react differently. In fact, they react 
less and act more. You see things you222ve never 
seen before.  You222re much more energetic, much more 
alive. People think that if they had no 
cravings, they222d be like deadwood. But in fact
 they222d lose their tension. Get rid of your 
fear of failure, your tensions about succeeding, you will be yourself. Relaxed. You 
wouldn222t be driving with your brak
es on. That222s what would happen.  There222s a lovely saying of Tranxu, a great 
Chinese sage, that 
I took the trouble to 
learn by heart. It goes: 223When the archer s
hoots for no particular prize, he has all his 
skills; when he shoots to win 
a brass buckle, he is already 
nervous; when he shoots for a 
gold prize, he goes blind, sees two targets,
 and is out of his 
mind. His skill has not 
changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more of winning than of 
shooting, and the need to win drains him of 
power.224 Isn222t that an image of what most 
people are? When you222re living for nothing, you
222ve got all your skills, you222ve got all 
your energy, you222re relaxed, you don222t care, it 
doesn222t matter whether you win or lose.  Now there222s 
human living for you. That222s what life is all about. That can only come 
from awareness. And in awareness you will 
understand that honor doesn222t mean a thing. 
It222s a social convention, that222s
 all. That222s why the mystics 
and the prophets didn222t bother 
one bit about it. Honor or disgrace meant nothing to them. They were living in another 
world, in the world of the awakened. Success 
or failure meant nothing to them. They had 
the attitude: 223I222m an ass, you222re 
an ass, so where222s the problem?224  Someone once said, 223The three most diffi
cult things for a human being are not   29  physical feats or intellectual achievements. Th
ey are, first, returning love for hate; 
second, including the excluded; third, adm
itting that you are wrong.224 But these are the 
easiest things in the world if you haven222t id
entified with the 223me.224 You can say things 
like 223I222m wrong! If you knew me better, you222d see how often I222m wrong. What would 
you expect from an ass?224 But if I haven222t iden
tified with these aspects of 223me,224 you can222t 
hurt me. Initially, the old conditioning will kick
 in and you222ll be depressed and anxious. 
You222ll grieve, cry, and so on. 223Before enlight
enment, I used to be
 depressed: after 
enlightenment, I continue to be depressed.224 Bu
t there222s a difference: I don222t identify with 
it anymore. Do you know what a big difference that is?  You step outside of yourself and look at 
that depression, and don222t identify with it. 
You don222t do a thing to make it go away; you ar
e perfectly willing to 
go on with your life 
while it passes through you and disappears. If you don222t know what that means, you 
really have something to look forward to. 
And anxiety? There it comes and you222re not 
troubled. How strange! You222re anxious but you222re not troubled.  Isn222t that a paradox? And you222re willing to 
let this cloud come in, because the more 
you fight it, the more power you give it. You222re willing to observe it as it passes by. You 
can be happy in your anxiety. Isn222t that cr
azy? You can be happy in your depression. But 
you can222t have the wrong notion of happine
ss. Did you think happiness was excitement 
or thrills? That222s what caus
es the depression. Didn222t anyone te
ll you that? You222re thrilled, 
all right, but you222re just prep
aring the way for your next depression. You222re thrilled but 
you pick up the anxiety behind that: How can I 
make it last? That222s not happiness, that222s 
addiction.  I wonder how many nonaddicts there are reading this book? If 
you222re anything like 
the average group, there are few, very few.
 Don222t look down your nose at the alcoholics 
and the drug addicts: maybe you222re just as ad
dicted as they are. The first time I got a 
glimpse of this new world, it was terrifying. I 
understood what it meant to be alone, with 
nowhere to rest your head, to leave everyone free and be free yourself, to be special to no 
one and love everyone227because love does that. 
It shines on good and bad alike; it makes 
rain fall on saints and sinners alike.  Is it possible for the rose to say, 223I wi
ll give my fragrance to the good people who 
smell me, but I will withhold it from the bad224
? Or is it possible for 
the lamp to say, 223I 
will give my light to the good people in this room, but I will withhold it from the evil 
people224? Or can a tree say, 223I222ll give my sh
ade to the good people who rest under me, but 
I will withhold it from the bad224? These are images of what love is about.  It222s been there all along, staring us in 
the face in the scriptures, though we never 
cared to see it because we were so drowned in
 what our culture calls
 love with its love 
songs and poems227that isn222t love at all, th
at222s the opposite of love. That222s desire and 
control and possessiveness. That
222s manipulation, and fear, a
nd anxiety227that222s not love. 
We were told that happiness is a smooth 
complexion, a holiday resort. It isn222t these 
things, but we have subtle ways of maki
ng our happiness depend on other things, both 
within us and outside us. We say, 223I refuse 
to be happy until my neurosis goes.224 I have 
good news for you: You can be happy right now, 
with
 the neurosis, You want even better 
news? There222s only one reason why you222re not
 experiencing what in India we call 
anand227bliss, bliss. There222s only one reason why you222re not experien
cing bliss at this 
present moment, and it222s because you222re thinking or focusing on what you don222t have. 
Otherwise you would be experiencing bli
ss. You222re focusing on what you don222t have.   30  But, right now you have everything you need to be in bliss.  Jesus was talking horse sense to lay people,
 to starving people, to poor people. He 
was telling them good news: It222s yours fo
r the taking. But who listens? No one222s 
interested, they222d rather be asleep.      FEAR THE ROOT  OF VIOLENCE    Some say that there are only two things in 
the world: God and fear; love and fear are 
the only two things. There222s only one evil in 
the world, fear. There222
s only one good in the 
world, love. It222s sometimes called by other 
names. It222s sometimes called happiness or 
freedom or peace or joy or God or whatever. But the label doesn222t really matter. And 
there222s not a single evil in the world 
that you cannot trace to fear. Not one.  Ignorance and fear, ignorance caused by f
ear, that222s where all 
the evil comes from, 
that222s where your violence comes from. Th
e person who is truly nonviolent, who is 
incapable of violence, is the person who is f
earless. It222s only when you222re afraid that you 
become angry. Think of the last time you were angry. Go ahead. Think of the last time 
you were angry and search for the fear behind 
it. What were you afraid of losing? What 
were you afraid would be taken from you? That222s where the anger comes from. Think of 
an angry person, maybe someone you222re afraid
 of. Can you see how frightened he or she 
is? He222s really frightened, he 
really is. She222s really frightened or she wouldn222t be angry. 
Ultimately, there are only two things, love and fear.  In this retreat I222d rather leave it like th
is, unstructured and moving from one thing to 
another and returning to themes again and ag
ain, because that222s the way to really grasp 
what I222m saying. If it doesn222t hit you the fi
rst time, it might the second time, and what 
doesn222t hit one person might hit another. I222ve got different themes, but they are all about 
the same thing. Call it awareness, call it love
, call it spirituality or 
freedom or awakening 
or whatever. It really is the same thing.      AWARENESS AND CONTACT  WITH REALITY    To watch everything inside of you and 
outside, and when there is something 
happening to you, to see it as if it were happe
ning to someone else, with no comment, no 
judgment, no attitude, no interference, no attempt to change, only to understand. As you 
do this, you222ll begin to realize that increasin
gly you are disidentifying from 223me.224 St. 
Teresa of Avila says that toward the end of 
her life God gave her an extraordinary grace. 
She doesn222t use this modern expression, of c
ourse, but what it really boils down to is 
disidentifying from herself. If someone el
se has cancer and I don222t know the person, I222m 
not all that affected. If I had love and sens
itivity, maybe I222d help, but I222m not emotionally 
affected. If 
you
 have an examination to take, I222m not all that affected. I can be quite 
philosophical about it and say, 223Well, the more you worry about it, the worse it222ll get.   31  Why not just take a good break instead of st
udying?224 But when it222s my turn to have an 
examination, well, that222s something else, isn222
t it? The reason is that
 I222ve identified with 
223me224227with my family, my country, my po
ssessions, my body, me. How would it be if 
God gave me grace not to call these things mi
ne? I222d be detached; I222d be disidentified. 
That222s what it means to lose the self
, to deny the self, to die to self.      GOOD RELIGION  THE ANTITHESIS  OF UNAWARENESS    Somebody came up to me once during a conf
erence and asked, 223What about 221Our 
Lady of Fatima222? What do you think of her?224 When I am asked questi
ons like that, I am 
reminded of the story of the time they were ta
king the statue of Our Lady of Fatima on an 
airplane to a pilgrimage for worship, and as 
they were flying over the South of France the 
plane began to wobble and to shake and it 
looked like it was going to
 come apart. And 
the miraculous statue cried out, 223Our Lady of
 Lourdes, pray for us!224 And all was well. 
Wasn222t it wonderful, one 223Our Lady224 helping another 223Our Lady224?  There was also a group of a thousand people who went on a pilgrimage to Mexico 
City to venerate the shrine 
of Our Lady of Guadalupe and sa
t down before the statue in 
protest because the Bishop of the Diocese had 
declared 223Our Lady of
 Lourdes224 patroness 
of the diocese! They were sure that Our La
dy of Guadalupe felt this very much, so they 
were doing the protest in 
reparation
 for the offense. That222s the trouble with religion, if 
you don222t watch out.  When I speak to Hindus, I tell them, 223Your priests are not going to be happy to hear 
this224 (notice how prudent I am this morn
ing), 223but God would be much happier, 
according to Jesus Christ, if you were transf
ormed than if you worshipped. He would be 
much more pleased by your loving than by your 
adoration.224 And when I talk to Moslems, 
I say, 223Your Ayatollah and your mullahs are not
 going to be happy to hear this, but God 
is going to be much more pleased by your be
ing transformed into a loving person than by 
saying, 223Lord, Lord.224 It222s infinitely more
 important that you be waking up. That222s 
spirituality, that222s everything. If you have that, you have God. Then you worship 223in 
spirit and in truth.224 When you become love
, when you are transformed into love. The 
danger of what religion can do 
is very nicely brought out in
 a story told by Cardinal 
Martini, the Archbishop of Mila
n. The story has to do with an 
Italian couple that222s getting 
married. They have an arrangement with the pari
sh priest to have a 
little reception in the 
parish courtyard outside the church. But it rained, and they couldn222t have the reception, 
so they said to the priest, 223Would it be all ri
ght if we had the celebr
ation in the church?224  Now Father wasn222t one bit happy about having a reception in the church, but they 
said, 223We will eat a little cak
e, sing a little song, drink a lit
tle wine, and then go home.224 
So Father was persuaded. But being good life-loving Italians they 
drank a little wine, 
sang a little song, then drank a little more 
wine, and sang some more songs, and within a 
half hour there was a great celebratio
n going on in the church. And everybody was 
having a great time, lots of fun and frolic. 
But Father was all tense, pacing up and down   32  in the sacristy, all upset about
 the noise they were making. Th
e assistant pastor comes in 
and says, 223I see you are quite tense224.  223Of course, I222m tense. Listen to all the 
noise they are making, and in the House of 
God!, for heaven222s sake!224  223Well, Father, they really had no place to go.224  223I know that! But do they have to make all that racket?224  223Well, we mustn222t forget, must we, Father
, that Jesus himself was once present at a 
wedding!224  Father says, 223I know Jesus Christ
 was present at a wedding banquet, 
YOU don222t 
have to tell me Jesus Christ was present at
 a wedding banquet! But they didn222t have the 
Blessed Sacrament there!!!224  You know there are times like that when
 the Blessed Sacrament becomes more 
important than Jesus Christ. When worship b
ecomes more important than love, when the 
Church becomes more important than life. When God becomes more important than the 
neighbor. And so it goes on. That222s the danger.
 To my mind this is what Jesus was 
evidently calling us to227first th
ings first! The human being is
 much more important than 
the Sabbath. Doing what I tell you, namely, becoming what I am indicating to you, is 
much more important than Lord, Lord. But 
your mullah is not going to be happy to hear 
that, I assure you. Your priests are not going to
 be happy to hear that. Not generally. So 
that222s what we have been talking about. Sp
irituality. Waking up. And as I told you, it is 
extremely important if you want to wake up to go in for what 
I call 223self-observation.224 Be 
aware of what you222re saying, be aware of wh
at you222re doing, be aware of what you222re 
thinking, be aware of how you222re acting. Be 
aware of where you222re coming from, what 
your motives are. The unaware life is not worth living.  The unaware life is a mechanical life. It222s not human, it222s programmed, conditioned. 
We might as well be a stone, a block of 
wood. In the country where I come from, you 
have hundreds of thousands of people living in
 little hovels, in extreme poverty, who just 
manage to survive, working all day long, ha
rd manual work, sleep and then wake up in 
the morning, eat something, and start all ove
r again. And you sit back and think, 223What a 
life.224 223Is that all that life holds in store fo
r them?224 And then you222re suddenly jolted into 
the realization that 99.999% of people here
 are not much better. You can go to the 
movies, drive around in a car, you can go for 
a cruise. Do you think you are much better 
off than they are? You are just as dead as th
ey are. Just as much a machine as they are227a 
slightly bigger one, but a mach
ine nevertheless. That222s sad. It
222s sad to think that people 
go through life like this.  People go through life with fixed 
ideas; they never change. 
They222re just not aware of 
what222s going on. They might as well be a bl
ock of wood, or a roc
k, a talking, walking, 
thinking machine. That222s not human. They are puppets, jerked around by all kinds of 
things. Press a button and you get a reaction. Y
ou can almost predict how this person is 
going to react. If I study a pers
on, I can tell you just how he or 
she is going to react. With 
my therapy group, sometimes I write on a piece of
 paper that so-and-so is going to start 
the session and so-and-so will reply. Do you thi
nk that222s bad? Well, don222t listen to people 
who say to you, 223Forget yourself! Go out in love 
to others.224 Don222t listen to them! They222re 
all wrong. The worst thing you can do is forget 
yourself when you go out to others in the 
so-called helping attitude.  This was brought home to me very forcibly 
many years ago when I did my studies in   33  psychology in Chicago. We had a course in c
ounseling for priests. 
It was open only to 
priests who were actually engaged in counsel
ing and who agreed to bring a taped session 
to class. There must have been about twen
ty of us. When it was my turn, I brought a 
cassette with an interview I had had with
 a young woman. The instructor put it in a 
recorder and we all began to listen to it. 
After five minutes, as was his custom, the 
instructor stopped the tape and asked, 223Any 
comments?224 Someone said to me, 223Why did 
you ask her that question?224 I sa
id, 223I222m not aware that I as
ked her a question. As a matter 
of fact, I222m quite sure I did 
not ask any questions.224 He sai
d, 223You did.224 I was quite sure 
because at that time I was consciously follo
wing the method of Carl Rogers, which is 
person-oriented and nondirective. You don222
t ask questions. and you don222t interrupt or 
give advice. So I was very aware that I 
mustn222t ask questions. Anyway, there was a 
dispute between us, so the instructor said, 
223Why don222t we play the tape again?224 So we 
played it again and there, to my horror,
 was a whopping big ques
tion, as tall as the 
Empire State Building, a huge question. The inte
resting thing to me was that I had heard 
that question three times, the 
first time, presumably, when I asked it, the second time 
when I listened to the tape in
 my room (because I wanted to take a good tape to class), 
and the third time when I heard it in the classroom. But it hadn222t registered! I wasn222t 
aware.  That happens frequently in my therapy se
ssions or in my spiritual direction. We 
tape-record the interview, and when the client listens to it, he or she says, 223You know, I 
didn222t really hear what you sa
id during the interview. I only 
heard what you said when I 
listened to the tape.224 More interestingly, 
I
 didn222t hear what 
I
 said during the interview. 
It222s shocking to discover that I222m saying thin
gs in a therapy session that I222m not aware of. 
The full import of them only dawns on me later. Do you call that 
human
? 223Forget 
yourself and go out to others,224 you say! Anyhow, 
after we listened to the whole tape there 
in Chicago, the instructor sa
id, 223Are there any comments?224 
One of the priests, a fifty-
year-old man to whom I had taken a liki
ng, said to me, 223Tony, I222d like to ask you a 
personal question. Would that be all right?224 I 
said, 223Yes, go ahead. If I don222t want to 
answer it, I won222t.224 He said, 223Is th
is woman in the interview pretty?224  You know, honest to goodness, I was at a stage of my development (or 
undevelopment) where I didn222t notice if someone was good-looking or not. It didn222t 
matter to me. She was a sheep of Christ222s fl
ock; I was a pastor. I 
dispensed help. Isn222t 
that great! It was the way we were trained. So 
I said to him, 223What222s that got to do with 
it?224 He said, 223Because you don222t like her, do 
you?224 I said, 223What?!224 It hadn222t ever struck 
me that I liked or disliked individuals. Like most people, I had an occasional dislike that 
would register in consciousness, but my 
attitude was mostly neutral. I asked, 223What 
makes you say that?224 He said, 223The tape.224 We went through the tape again, and he said, 
223Listen to your voice. Notice how sweet it has become. You222re irr
itated, aren222t you?224 I 
was, and I was only becoming aware of it ri
ght there. And what was I saying to her 
nondirectively? I was saying, 223Don222t come back.224
 But I wasn222t aware 
of that. My priest 
friend said, 223She222s a woman. She will have picked this up. When are you supposed to 
meet her next?224 I said, 223Next Wednesday.224 He
 said, 223My guess is she won222t come back.224 
She didn222t. I waited one week but she didn222t co
me. I waited another week and she didn222t 
come. Then I called her. I broke one of
 my rules: Don222t be the rescuer.  I called her and said to her, 223Remember th
at tape you allowed me to make for the 
class? It was a great help because the class po
inted out all kinds of 
things to me224 (I didn222t   34  tell her what!) 223that would make the session so
mewhat more effective. So if you care to 
come back, that would make it more effectiv
e.224 She said, 223All right, I222ll come back.224 She 
did. The dislike was still there. It hadn222t 
gone away, but it wasn222t getting in the way. 
What you are aware of you are in
 control of; what you are not 
aware of is in control of 
you. You are always a slave to what you222re not 
aware of. When you222re 
aware of it, you222re 
free from it. It222s there, but you222re not aff
ected by it. You222re not controlled by it; you222re 
not enslaved by it. That222s the difference.  Awareness, awareness, awareness, awareness.
 What they trained us to do in that 
course was to become participant observers. To put it somewhat graphically, I222d be 
talking to you and at the sa
me time I222d be out there watching you and watching me. 
When I222m listening to you, it222s in
finitely more important for me
 to listen to me than to 
listen to you. Of course, it222s important to listen
 to you, but it222s more important that I listen 
to me. Otherwise I won222t be hearing you. Or 
I222ll be distorting ev
erything you say. I222ll be 
coming at you from my own conditioning. I222ll be
 reacting to you in 
all kinds of ways 
from my insecurities, from 
my need to manipulate you, from my desire to succeed, from 
irritations and feelings that I might not be aware of. So it222s frightfully important that I 
listen to me when I222m listening to you. That222s
 what they were trai
ning us to do, obtaining 
awareness.  You don222t always have to imagine yourself 
hovering somewhere in the air. Just to 
get a rough idea of what I222m talking about, 
imagine a good driver, driving a car, who222s 
concentrating on what you222re saying. In fact, he may even be having an argument with 
you, but he222s perfectly aware of the road
 signals. The moment anything untoward 
happens, the moment there222s any sound, or noise
, or bump, he222ll hear it at once. He222ll say, 
223Are you sure you closed that 
door back there?224 How did he do that? He was aware, he 
was alert. The focus of his attention was 
on the conversation, or argument, but his 
awareness was more diffused. He wa
s taking in all kinds of things.  What I222m advocating here is not conc
entration. That222s not important. Many 
meditative techniques inculcat
e concentration, but I222m leer
y of that. They involve 
violence and frequently th
ey involve further programm
ing and conditioning. What I 
would advocate is awareness, which is not the 
same as concentration 
at all. Concentration 
is a spotlight, a floodlight. You222re open to 
anything that comes within the scope of your 
consciousness. You can be distracted from 
that, but when you222re practicing awareness, 
you222re never distracted. When awareness is turned on, there222s never any distraction, 
because you222re always aware of whatever happens to be.  Say I222m looking at those trees
 and I222m worrying. Am I dist
racted? I am distracted 
only if I mean to concentrate on the trees. Bu
t if I222m aware that I222m worried, too, that 
isn222t a distraction at all. Just be aware of
 where your attention goes. When anything goes 
awry or anything untoward happens, you222ll be 
alerted at once. Something222s going wrong! 
The moment any negative feeling comes in
to consciousness, you222ll be alerted. You222re 
like the driver of the car.  I told you that St. Teresa of Avila said 
God gave her the grace of disidentifying 
herself with herself. You hear children talk
 that way. A two-year-old says, 223Tommy had 
his breakfast this morning.224 He doesn222t say 223I,224 although he 
is Tommy. He says 
223Tommy224227in the third person. Mystics feel 
that way. They have disidentified from 
themselves and they are at peace.  This was the grace St. Teresa was talking 
about. This is the 223I224 that the mystic   35  masters of the East are constantly urging peopl
e to discover. And those of the West, too! 
And you can count Meister Eckhart among them
. They are urging people to discover the 
223I.224      LABELS    The important thing is not to know who I 
is or what 223I224 is. You222ll never succeed. 
There are no words for it. The important thing 
is to drop the labels. As the Japanese Zen 
masters say, 223Don222t seek the truth; just 
drop your opinions.224 Drop your theories; don222t 
seek the truth. Truth isn222t something you s
earch for. If you stop being opinionated, you 
would know. Something similar happens here
. If you drop your labe
ls, you would know. 
What do I mean by labels? Every label you can 
conceive of except perhaps that of human 
being. I am a human being. Fair enough; doesn222t say very much. But when you say, 223I am 
successful,224 that222s crazy. Success is not part of
 the 223I.224 Success is something that comes 
and goes; it could be here t
oday and gone tomorrow. That222s not 223I.224 When you said, 223I 
was a success,224 you were in error; you were
 plunged into darkness. You identified 
yourself with success. The same thing when
 you said, 223I am a failure, a lawyer, a 
businessman.224 You know what222s going to happen to you if you identify yourself with 
these things. You222re going to cling to them, 
you222re going to be worried that they may fall 
apart, and that222s where your suffering comes in. That is what I meant earlier when I said 
to you, 223If you222re suffering, you222re asleep.224 Do you want a sign that 
you222re asleep? Here 
it is: You222re suffering. Suffering is a sign th
at you222re out of touch with the truth. 
Suffering is given to you that you might ope
n your eyes to the 
truth, that you might 
understand that there222s falsehood somewhere, ju
st as physical pain is given to you so you 
will understand that there is di
sease or illness somewhere. Suffering points out that there 
is falsehood somewhere. Suffering occurs 
when you clash with reality. When your 
illusions clash with reality, when your fals
ehoods clash with truth, then you have 
suffering. Otherwise there is no suffering.      OBSTACLES TO HAPPINESS    What I222m about to say will sound a bit pompous
, but it222s true. What is coming could 
be the most important minutes in your liv
es. If you could grasp this, you222d hit upon the 
secret of awakening. You would be happy 
forever. You would never be unhappy again. 
Nothing would have the power to hurt you again. I mean that, nothing. It222s like when you 
throw black paint in the air; the air remains uncontaminated. You never color the air 
black. No matter what happens to you, you remain uncontaminated. You remain at peace. 
There are human beings who have attained
 this, what I call being human. Not this 
nonsense of being a puppet, jerked about this
 way and that way, letting events or other 
people tell you how to feel. So you proceed to
 feel it and you call it being vulnerable. Ha! 
I call it being a puppet. So you want to be 
a puppet? Press a butt
on and you222re down; do 
you like that? But if you refuse to
 identify with any of those 
labels, most of your worries 
cease.   36  Later we222ll talk about fear of disease a
nd death, but ordinarily you222re worried about 
what222s going to happen to your career. A small-
time businessman, fifty-five years old, is 
sipping beer at a bar somewhere and he222s sa
ying, 223Well, look at my classmates, they222ve 
really made it.224 The idiot! What does he m
ean, 223They made it224? They222ve got their names 
in the newspaper. Do you call that making it? 
One is president of 
the corporation; the 
other has become the Chief justice; somebody else has become
 this or that. Monkeys, all 
of them.  Who determines what it means to be a su
ccess? This stupid society! The main 
preoccupation of society is to keep societ
y sick! And the sooner you realize that, the 
better. Sick, every one of them. They are 
loony, they222re crazy. You became president of 
the lunatic asylum and you222re proud of it 
even though it means nothing. Being president 
of a corporation has nothing to do with being 
a success in life. Having a lot of money has 
nothing to do with being a success in life. 
You222re a success in life when you wake up! 
Then you don222t have to apologize to anyone
, you don222t have to explain anything to 
anyone, you don222t give a damn what anybody th
inks about you or what anybody says 
about you. You have no worries; you222re happy. That222s what I call being a success. 
Having a good job or being famous or having a 
great reputation has ab
solutely nothing to 
do with happiness or success. Nothing! It is 
totally irrelevant. All he222s really worried 
about is what his children will think about hi
m, what the neighbors will think about him, 
what his wife will think about him. He s
hould have become famous. Our society and 
culture drill that into our heads day and ni
ght. People who made it! Made what?! Made 
asses of themselves. Because they drained 
all their energy getting something that was 
worthless. They222re frightened and confused, they are puppets like the rest. Look at them 
strutting across the stage. Look how upset they get if they have a stai
n on their shirt. Do 
you call that a success? Look at how frightened th
ey are at the prospect they might not be 
reelected. Do you call that a success? They 
are controlled, so manipulated. They are 
unhappy people, they are miserable people. Th
ey don222t enjoy life. Th
ey are constantly 
tense and anxious. Do you call that human?
 And do you know why that happens? Only 
one reason: They identified with some label. 
They identified the 223I224 with their money or 
their job or their professi
on. That was their error.  Did you hear about the lawyer who was presen
ted with a plumber222s bill? He said to 
the plumber, 223Hey, you222re charging me two hun
dred dollars an hour. I don222t make that 
kind of money as a lawyer.224 The plumber sai
d, 223I didn222t make that kind of money when I 
was a lawyer either!224 You could be a plumber 
or a lawyer or a businessman or a priest, 
but that does not affect the essential 223I224. It 
doesn222t affect you. If I 
change my profession 
tomorrow, it222s just like changing my clothes. I am untouched. 
Are
 you your clothes? 
Are
 
you your name? 
Are
 you your profession? Stop identifyi
ng with them. They come and go.  When you really understand this
, no criticism can affect 
you. No flattery or praise 
can affect you either. When someone says, 223Y
ou222re a great guy,224 wh
at is he talking 
about? He222s talking about 223me,224 
he222s not talking about 223I.224 223I
224 is neither great nor small. 
223I224 is neither successful nor a failure. It is 
none of these labels. These things come and 
go. These things depend on the criteria society establishes.
 These things depend on your 
conditioning. These things depend on the mood of the person who happens to be talking 
to you right now. It has nothing to do with 
223I.224 223I224 is none of these labels. 223Me224 is 
generally selfish, foolish, child
ish227a great big ass. So wh
en you say, 223You222re an ass,224 
I222ve known it for years! The conditioned 
self227what did you expect? I222ve known it for   37  years. Why do you identify with him? 
Silly! That isn222t 223I
,224 that222s 223me.224  Do you want to be happy? Uninterrupted happiness is uncaused. True happiness is 
uncaused. You cannot make me happy. You are not my happiness. You say to the 
awakened person, 223Why are you happy?224 and 
the awakened person replies, 223Why not?224  Happiness is our natural state. Happiness is 
the natural state of little children, to 
whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the 
stupidity of society and culture. To acqui
re happiness you don222t have to do anything, 
because happiness cannot be acquired. Does anybody know why? Because we have it 
already. How can you acquire what you alrea
dy have? Then why don222
t you experience it? 
Because you222ve got to drop something. You222ve
 got to drop illusions. You don222t have to 
add anything in order to be happy; you222ve 
got to drop something. Life is easy, life is 
delightful. It222s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings. Do 
you know where these things come from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!      FOUR STEPS TO WISDOM    The first thing you need to do is get in t
ouch with negative feelings that you222re not 
even aware of. Lots of people have negative f
eelings they222re not aware of. Lots of people 
are depressed and they222re not aware they are depressed. It222s only when they make contact 
with joy that they understand how
 depressed they were. You can222t deal with a cancer that 
you haven222t detected. You can222t get rid of bo
ll weevils on your farm 
if you222re not aware 
of their existence. The first 
thing you need is awareness of
 your negative feelings. What 
negative feelings? Gloominess, for instance.
 You222re feeling gloom
y and moody. You feel 
self-hatred or guilt. You feel th
at life is pointless, that it ma
kes no sense; you222ve got hurt 
feelings, you222re feeling nervous and tense. Get in touch 
with those feelings first.  The second step (this is a four-step program) 
is to understand that the feeling is in 
you, not in reality. That222s such a self-evi
dent thing, but do you think people know it? 
They don222t, believe me. They222ve got Ph.D.s a
nd are presidents of universities, but they 
haven222t understood this. They didn222t teach me
 how to live at school. They taught me 
everything else. As one man sa
id, 223I got a pretty good education. It took me years to get 
over it.224 That222s what spirituality is all about, you know: unlearning. Unlearning all the 
rubbish they taught you.  Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. 
So stop trying to change reality. That222s 
crazy! Stop trying to change the other person. 
We spend all our time and energy trying to 
change external circumstances, trying to ch
ange our spouses, our bo
sses, our friends, our 
enemies, and everybody else. We don222t have to
 change anything. Negative feelings are in 
you. No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy. There is no event on earth 
that has the power to disturb you or hurt you. 
No event, condition, situation, or person. 
Nobody told you this; they told you the opposit
e. That222s why you222re in the mess that 
you222re in right now. That is why you222re asl
eep. They never told you this. But it222s self-
evident.  Let222s suppose that rain washes out a picnic
. Who is feeling negative? The rain? Or 
you
? What222s causing the negative feeling? The rain or your reaction? When you bump 
your knee against a table, the table222s fine. It
222s busy being what it was made to be227a 
table. The pain is in your knee, not in the ta
ble. The mystics keep trying to tell us that   38  reality is all right. Reality is not problematic. Problems exist only in the human mind. We 
might add: in the stupid, sleeping human mi
nd. Reality is not problematic. Take away 
human beings from this planet and life
 would go on, nature would go on in all its 
loveliness and violence. Where would the problem be? No problem. You created the 
problem. You are the problem. You identifie
d with 223me224 and that is the problem. The 
feeling is in you, not in reality.  The third step: Never identify 
with that feeling. It has 
nothing to do with the 223I.224 
Don222t define your essential self in terms of 
that feeling. Don222t say, 223I am depressed.224 If 
you want to say, 223It is depressed,224
 that222s all ri
ght. If you want to sa
y depression is there, 
that222s fine; if you want to say gloominess is there, that222s fine. But not: I am gloomy. 
You222re defining yourself in terms of the fee
ling. That222s your illusion; that222s your mistake. 
There is a depression there right now, there ar
e hurt feelings there ri
ght now, but let it be, 
leave it alone. It will pass. Everything pa
sses, everything. Your depressions and your 
thrills have nothing to do with happiness. T
hose are the swings of
 the pendulum. If you 
seek kicks or thrills, get ready for depre
ssion. Do you want your drug? Get ready for the 
hangover. One end of the pendulum swings to the other.  This has nothing to do with 223I224; it has nothing 
to do with happiness. It is the 223me.224 If 
you remember this, if you say it to yourself a thousand times, 
if you try these three steps a 
thousand times, you will get it. You might not 
need to do it even three times. I don222t 
know; there222s no rule for it. But do it a t
housand times and you222ll make the biggest 
discovery in your life. To hell with those 
gold mines in Alaska. What are you going to do 
with that gold? If you222re 
not happy, you can222t live. So 
you found gold. What does that 
matter? You222re a king; you222re a princess. 
You222re free; you don222t care anymore about 
being accepted or rejected, that makes no diffe
rence. Psychologists te
ll us how important 
it is to get a sense of belonging. Baloney! Why do you want
 to belong to anybody? It 
doesn222t matter anymore.  A friend of mine told me that there222s 
an African tribe wher
e capital punishment 
consists of being ostracized. If you were kicked out of New York, or wherever you222re 
residing, you wouldn222t die. How is it that
 the African tribesman died? Because he 
partakes of the common stupidity of humanity. He
 thinks he will not be able to live if he 
does not belong. It222s very different from most pe
ople, or is it? He222s convinced he needs to 
belong. But you don222t need to belong to 
anybody or anything or 
any group. You don222t 
even need to be in love. Who told you you do? What you need is to be free. What you 
need is to love. That222s it; th
at222s your nature. But what you222re 
really telling me is that you 
want to be desired. You want to be applaude
d, to be attractive, to
 have all the little 
monkeys running after you.  You222re wasting your life. 
Wake up!
 You don222t need this. You can be blissfully 
happy without it.  Your society is not going to be happy to hear this, because you become terrifying 
when you open your eyes and understand this. 
How do you control a person like this? He 
doesn222t need you; he222s not threatened by your 
criticism; he doesn222t care what you think of 
him or what you say about him. He222s cut all 
those strings; he222s 
not a puppet any longer. 
It222s terrifying. 223So we222ve got to
 get rid of him. He tells the 
truth; he has become fearless; 
he has stopped being human.224 
Human!
 Behold! A human being at
 last! He broke out of 
his slavery, broke out
 of their prison.  No event justifies a negative feeling. There 
is no situation in the 
world that justifies   39  a negative feeling. That222s what all our mystic
s have been crying themselves hoarse to tell 
us. But nobody listens. The negative feeling is
 in you. In the Bhagavad-Gita, the sacred 
book of the Hindus, Lord Krishna says to Arjuna, 223Plunge into the heat of battle and keep 
your heart at the lotus feet of 
the Lord.224 A marvelous sentence.  You don222t have to do anything to acquire ha
ppiness. The great Meister Eckhart said 
very beautifully, 223God is not attained by a process of addition to anything in the soul, but 
by a process of subtraction.224 You don222t do anything to be free, you drop something. Then 
you222re free.  It reminds me of the Irish prisoner w
ho dug a tunnel under the prison wall and 
managed to escape. He comes out right in the 
middle of a school playground where little 
children are playing. Of course, when he em
erges from the tunnel he can222t restrain 
himself anymore and begins to jump up and 
down, crying, 223I222m free, I222m free, I222m free!224 
A little girl there looks at
 him scornfully and says, 223That222s nothing. I222m four.224  The fourth step: How do you change things? How do you change yourselves? There 
are many things you must understand here, or ra
ther, just one thing that can be expressed 
in many ways. Imagine a patient who goes to a doctor and tells him what he is suffering 
from. The doctor says, 223Very well, I222ve 
understood your symptoms. Do you know what I 
will do? I will prescribe a medicine for your neighbor!224 The patient replies, 223Thank you 
very much, Doctor, that makes me feel much 
better.224 Isn222t that absurd? But that222s what 
we all do. The person who is asleep always 
thinks he222ll feel better if somebody else 
changes. You222re suffering because you are 
asleep, but you222re thinking, 223How wonderful 
life would be if somebody else would cha
nge; how wonderful life would be if my 
neighbor changed, my wife changed, my boss changed.224  We always want someone else to change 
so that we will feel good. But has it ever 
struck you that even if your wife changes or
 your husband changes, what does that do to 
you? You222re just as vulnerable 
as before; you222re just as idioti
c as before; you222re just as 
asleep as before. You are the one who needs 
to change, who needs to take medicine. You 
keep insisting, 223I feel good because the world is right.224 
Wrong!
 The world is right 
because I feel good. That222s what all the mystics are saying.        ALL222S RIGHT WITH  THE WORLD    When you awaken, when you understand, when you see, the world becomes right. 
We222re always bothered by the problem of evil. There222s a powerful st
ory about a little boy 
walking along the bank of a river. He sees 
a crocodile who is trapped in a net. The 
crocodile says, 223Would you have pity on me and release me? I may look ugly, but it isn222t 
my fault, you know. I was made this way. But wh
atever my external 
appearance, I have a 
mother222s heart. I came this morning in s
earch of food for my young ones and got caught 
in this trap!224 So the boy says, 223Ah, if I were 
to help you out of that trap, you222d grab me 
and kill me.224 The crocodile asks, 223Do you th
ink I would do that to my benefactor and 
liberator?224 So the boy is persuaded to take th
e net off and the crocodile grabs him. As he 
is being forced between the jaws of the crocodile, he says, 223So this is what I get for my 
good actions.224 And the crocodile says, 223Well, don222
t take it personally, son, this is the way   40  the world is, this is the law of life.224 The boy 
disputes this, so the 
crocodile says, 223Do you 
want to ask someone if it is
n222t so?224 The boys sees a bird 
sitting on a branch and says, 
223Bird, is what the crocodile says right?224 The 
bird says, 223The crocodile is right. Look at 
me. I was coming home one day with food for 
my fledglings. Imagine my horror to see a 
snake crawling up the tree, making straight for my nest. I was totally helpless. It kept 
devouring my young ones, one after the other. 
I kept screaming and shouting, but it was 
useless. The crocodile is right, 
this is the law of life, this is the way the world is.224 223See,224 
says the crocodile. But the boy says, 223Let me ask someone else.224 So the crocodile says, 
223Well, all right, go ahead.224 There was an ol
d donkey passing by on the bank of the river. 
223Donkey,224 says the boy, 223this is what the croc
odile says. Is the crocodile right?224 The 
donkey says, 223The crocodile is 
quite right. Look at me. I222ve worked and slaved for my 
master all my life and he barely gave me e
nough to eat. Now that I222m old and useless, he 
has turned me loose, and here I am wandering in the jungle, waiting for some wild beast 
to pounce on me and put an end to my life. The 
crocodile is right, this
 is the law of life, 
this is the way the world is.224 223See,224 says 
the crocodile. 223Let222s go!224 The boy says, 223Give 
me one more chance, one last chance. Let me ask one other being. Remember how good I 
was to you?224 So the crocodile says, 223All right, your last chance.224 The boy sees a rabbit 
passing by, and he says, 223Rabbit, is the croc
odile right?224 The rabbit 
sits on his haunches 
and says to the crocodile, 223Did
 you say that to that boy? The 
crocodile says, Yes, I did.224 
223Wait a minute,224 says the rabbit.
 223We222ve got to discuss this.224
 223Yes,224 says the crocodile. 
But the rabbit says, 223How can we discuss it when you222ve got that boy in your mouth? 
Release him; he222s got to take
 part in the discussion, too.224
 The crocodile says, 223You222re a 
clever one, you are. The moment I release hi
m, he222ll run away.224 The rabbit says, 223I 
thought you had more sense than that. If he a
ttempted to run away, one slash of your tail 
would kill him.224 223Fair enough,224 says the crocodile, and he released the boy. The moment 
the boy is released, the rabbit says, 223Run!224 And the boy runs and escapes. Then the rabbit 
says to the boy, 223Don222t you enjoy crocodile 
flesh? Wouldn222t the pe
ople in your village 
like a good meal? You didn222t really
 release that crocodile; most
 of his body is still caught 
in that net. Why don222t you go to the villag
e and bring everybody and have a banquet.224 
That222s exactly what the boy does. He goes to 
the village and calls all the menfolk. They 
come with their axes and staves and spear
s and kill the crocodile. The boy222s dog comes, 
too, and when the dog sees the rabbit, he gi
ves chase, catches hold of the rabbit, and 
throttles him. The boy comes on the scene too la
te, and as he watches the rabbit die, he 
says, 223The crocodile was right, this is the 
way the world is, this is the law of life.224  There is no explanation you can give that 
would explain away all the sufferings and 
evil and torture and destruction and hunger in 
the world! You222ll never explain it. You can 
try gamely with your formulas, religious 
and otherwise, but you222ll never explain it. 
Because life is a mystery, which means your thinking mind cannot make sense out of it. 
For that you222ve got to wake up and then you222
ll suddenly realize that reality is not 
problematic, you are the problem.      SLEEPWALKING    The scriptures are always hi
nting of that, but you222ll neve
r understand a word of what 
the scriptures are saying until you wake up. 
Sleeping people read the scriptures and   41  crucify the Messiah on the basis of them. You222ve
 got to wake up to make sense out of the 
scriptures. When you do wake up, they make sense. So does reality. But you222ll never be 
able to put it into words. You222d rather do so
mething? But even there we222ve got to make 
sure that you222re not swingi
ng into action simply to get 
rid of your negative feelings. 
Many people swing into action only to make
 things worse. They222re not coming from 
love, they222re coming from negative feelings. They222re coming from guilt, anger, hate; 
from a sense of injustice or whatever. You222ve
 got to make sure of your 223being224 before 
you swing into action. You have to make
 sure of who you are before you act. 
Unfortunately, when sleeping people swing into 
action, they simply substitute one cruelty 
for another, one injustice for another. And so
 it goes. Meister Eckhart
 says, 223It is not by 
your actions that you will be saved224 (or awak
ened; call it by any word you want), 223but by 
your being. It is not by what you do, but by wh
at you are that you will be judged.224 What 
good is it to you to feed the hungry, give the thir
sty to drink, or visit prisoners in jail?  Remember that sentence from Paul: 223If I give my body to be burned and all my 
goods to feed the poor and have not love . . .224
 It222s not your actions, 
it222s your being that 
counts. 
Then
 you might swing into action. You might 
or might not. You can222t decide that 
until you222re awake. Unfortunately, all the emphasis is concentrated on changing the 
world and very little emphasis is given to waking up. When you wake up, you will know 
what to do or what not to do. Some mystics 
are very strange, you know. Like Jesus, who 
said something like 223I wasn222t sent to those 
people; I limit myself to what I am supposed 
to do right now. Later, maybe.224 Some mystic
s go silent. Mysteriousl
y, some of them sing 
songs. Some of them are into
 service. We222re ne
ver sure. They222re a law unto themselves; 
they know exactly what is to be done. 223Plunge 
into the heat of battle and keep your heart 
at the lotus feet of the Lor
d,224 as I said to you earlier.  Imagine that you222re unwell and in a foul
 mood, and they222re taking you through some 
lovely countryside. The landscape is beautiful
 but you222re not in the mood to see anything. 
A few days later you pass the same place and you say, 223Good heavens, where was I that I 
didn222t notice all of this?224 Everything become
s beautiful when you change. Or you look at 
the trees and the mountains through windows that
 are wet with rain from a storm, and 
everything looks blurred and shapeless. You wa
nt to go right out there and change those 
trees, change those mountains. Wait a minut
e, let222s examine your window. When the 
storm ceases and the rain stops, and you look out the window, you say, 223Well, how 
different everything looks.224 We s
ee people and things not as they
 are, but as we are. That 
is why when two people look at something 
or someone, you get two different reactions. 
We see things and people not as
 they are, but as we are.  Remember that sentence from scripture a
bout everything turning into good for those 
who love God? When you finally awake, you don222t try to make good things happen; they 
just happen. You understand suddenly that ev
erything that happens to you is good. Think 
of some people you222re living with whom
 you want to change. You find them moody, 
inconsiderate, unreliable, trea
cherous, or whatever. But when
 you are different, they222ll be 
different. That222s an infallible and miracul
ous cure. The day you are different, they will 
become different. And you will see them
 differently, too. Someone who seemed 
terrifying will now seem frightened. Someone 
who seemed rude will seem frightened. All 
of a sudden, no one has the power to hurt you anymore. No one has the power to put 
pressure on you. It222s something like this: You 
leave a book on the table and I pick it up 
and say, 223You222re pressing this book on me. I have to pick it up or not pick it up.224 People   42  are so busy accusing everyone else, blaming ev
eryone else, blaming life, blaming society, 
blaming their neighbor. You222ll never change th
at way; you222ll conti
nue in your nightmare, 
you222ll never wake up.  Put this program into action, a thousand times
: (a) identify the negative feelings in 
you; (b) understand that they ar
e in you, not in the world, not 
in external reality; (c) do 
not see them as an essential part of 223I224; 
these things come and 
go; (d) understand that 
when you change, everything changes.       CHANGE AS GREED    That still leaves us with a big questio
n: Do I do anything to change myself?  I222ve got a big surprise for you, lots of
 good news! You don222t have to do anything. 
The more you do, the worse it gets. All you have to do is understand.  Think of somebody you are living with or working with whom 
you do not like, who 
causes negative feelings to arise in y
ou. Let222s help you to understand what222s going on. 
The first thing you need to understand is that 
the negative feeling is inside you. You are 
responsible for the negative feeling, not the other person. Someone else in your place 
would be perfectly calm and at ease in th
e presence of this pers
on; they wouldn222t be 
affected. 
You
 are. Now, understand another thi
ng, that you222re making a demand. You 
have an expectation of this person. Can you get in touch with that
? Then say to this 
person, 223I have no right to make any demands on you.224 In saying that, you will drop your 
expectation. 223I have no right to make any demands on you. Oh, I222ll protect myself from 
the consequences of your actions or your m
oods or whatever, but you can go right ahead 
and be what you choose to be. I have no right to make any demands on you.224  See what happens to you when you do this. If
 there222s a resistance to saying it, my, 
how much you222re going to discover about your 
223me.224 Let the dictator in you come out, let 
the tyrant come out. You thought you were 
such a little lamb, didn222t you? But I222m a 
tyrant and you222re a tyrant. A little variation on 223I222m an ass, you222re an ass.224 I222m a dictator, 
you222re a dictator. I want to run your life fo
r you; I want to tell you exactly how you222re 
expected to be and how you222re expected to
 behave, and you222d better behave as I have 
decided or I shall punish myself by having nega
tive feelings. Rememb
er what I told you, 
everybody222s a lunatic.  A woman told me her son had gotten an 
award at his high school. It was for 
excellence in sports and academics. She was happy for him, but was almost tempted to 
say to him, 223Don222t glory in that award, becau
se it222s setting you up for the time when you 
can222t perform as well.224 She was in a dilemma:
 how to prevent his future disillusionment 
without bursting his bubble now.  Hopefully, he222ll learn as she herself grows 
in wisdom. It222s not a matter of anything 
she says to him. It222s something that 
eventually she will become. Then she will 
understand. Then she will know what to say and 
when to say it. That award was a result 
of competition, which can be cruel if it is buil
t on hatred of oneself and of others. People 
get a good feeling on the basis of somebody getting a bad feeling; you win 
over
 
somebody else. Isn222t that terrible? Take
n for granted in a lunatic asylum!  There222s an American doctor who wrote abou
t the effect of competition on his life. 
He went to medical school in Switzerland a
nd there was a fairly large contingent of   43  Americans at that school. He said some of
 the students went into shock when they 
realized that there were no grad
es, there were no awards, there was no dean222s list, no first 
or second in the class at the sc
hool. You either passed or you 
didn222t. He said, 223Some of us 
just couldn222t take it. We became almost para
noid. We thought there must be some kind of 
trick here.224 So some of them went to 
another school. Those who survived suddenly 
discovered a strange thing they had never not
iced at American universities: students, 
brilliant ones, helping others to pass, sharing 
notes. His son goes to medical school in the 
United States and he tells him that, in the la
b, people often tamper with the microscope so 
that it222ll take the next student 
three or four minutes to read
just it. Competition. They have 
to succeed, they have to be perfect. And he te
lls a lovely little st
ory which he says is 
factual, but it could also serv
e as a beautiful parable. There 
was a little town in America 
where people gathered in the evening to
 make music. They had a saxophonist, a 
drummer, and a violinis
t, mostly old people. They got 
together for the company and for 
the sheer joy of making music, though they didn
222t do it very well. So they were enjoying 
themselves, having a great time, until one da
y they decided to get a new conductor who 
had a lot of ambition and drive. The new conduc
tor told them, 223Hey, folks, we have to 
have a concert; we have to prepare a concert for the town.224 Then he gradually got rid of 
some people who didn222t play too well, hire
d a few professional musicians, got an 
orchestra into shape, and they all got th
eir names in the newspapers. Wasn222t that 
wonderful? So they decided to move to the bi
g city and play there. But some of the old 
people had tears in their eyes, 
they said, 223It was so wonderful in the old days when we 
did things badly and enjoyed them.224 So 
cruelty came into their lives, but nobody 
recognized it as cruelty. See how
 lunatic people have become!  Some of you ask me what I meant when
 I said, 223You go ahead and be yourself, 
that222s all right, but I222ll protect myself, I222ll 
be myself.224 In other words, I won222t allow you 
to manipulate me. I222ll live my life; I222ll go my 
own way; I222ll keep myse
lf free to think my 
thoughts, to follow my inclinations and tast
es. And I222ll say no to you. If I feel I don222t 
want to be in your company, it won222t be becau
se of any negative feelings you cause in 
me. Because you don222t anymore. You don222t have any more power over me. I simply 
might prefer other people222s company. So when you say to me, 223How about a movie 
tonight?224 I222ll say, 223Sorry, I want to go with 
someone else; I enjoy his company more than 
yours.224 And that222s all right. To say no to people227that222s wonderful; that222s part of waking 
up. Part of waking up is that you live your life 
as you see fit. And understand: That is not 
selfish. The selfish thing is to demand that 
someone else live their life as YOU see fit. 
That222s
 selfish. It is not selfish 
to live your life as you see fit.
 The selfishness lies in 
demanding that someone else live their life 
to suit your tastes, or your pride, or your 
profit, or your pleasure. That 
is truly selfish. So I222ll protect myself. I won222t feel obligated 
to be with you; I won222t feel obligated to 
say yes to you. If I find your company pleasant, 
then I222ll enjoy it without clinging to it. But 
I no longer avoid you because of any negative 
feelings you create in me. You don222t have that power anymore.  Awakening should be a surprise. When you 
don222t expect something to happen and it 
happens, you feel surprise. Wh
en Webster222s wife caught him kissing the maid, she told 
him she was very surprised. Now, Webster wa
s a stickler for using words accurately 
(understandably, since he wrote 
a dictionary), so he answered her, 223No, my dear, I am 
surprised. You are astonished!224  Some people make awakening a goal. They ar
e determined to get there; they say, 223I   44  refuse to be happy until I222m awakened.224 In th
at case, it222s better 
to be the way you are, 
simply to be aware of the way you are. Si
mple awareness is happiness compared with 
trying to react all the time. People react so 
quickly because they are not aware. You will 
come to understand that there are times 
when you will inevitably react, even in 
awareness. But as awareness gr
ows, you react less and act more
. It really doesn222t matter.  There222s a story of a disciple who told hi
s guru that he was going to a far place to 
meditate and hopefully attain enlightenment. So
 he sent the guru a note every six months 
to report the progress he was making. The fi
rst report said, 223Now I understand what it 
means to lose the self.224 The guru tore up th
e note and threw it in the wastepaper basket. 
After six months he got another report, which sa
id, 223Now I have attained sensitivity to all 
beings.224 He tore it up. Then a third report sa
id, 223Now I understand the secret of the one 
and the many.224 It too was torn up. And so it went on for years, until finally no reports 
came in. After a time the guru became curious 
and one day there was a traveler going to 
that far place. The guru said, 223Why don222t you 
find out what happened 
to that fellow.224 
Finally, he got a note from his disciple. It
 said, 223What does it matter?224 And when the 
guru read that, he said, 223He 
made it! He made it! He finally got it! He got it!224  And there is the story about a soldier on 
the battlefield who would simply drop his 
rifle to the ground, pick up a scrap of paper lyin
g there, and look at it. Then he would let 
it flutter from his hands to the ground. And 
then he222d move somewhere else and do the 
same thing. So others said, 223This man is e
xposing himself to death. He needs help.224 So 
they put him in the hospital and got the best ps
ychiatrist to work on him. But it seemed to 
have no effect. He wandered around the wards 
picking up scraps of paper, looking at 
them idly, and letting them flutter to the ground. In the e
nd they said, 223We222ve got to 
discharge this man from the army.224 So th
ey call him in and give him a discharge 
certificate and he idly picks it up, 
looks at it, and shouts, 223This is
 it? This is it.224 He finally 
got it.  So begin to be aware of your present 
condition whatever th
at condition is. Stop 
being a dictator. Stop trying to push yourself somewhere. Then someday you will 
understand that simply by awareness you have 
already attained what you were pushing 
yourself toward.      A CHANGED PERSON    In your pursuit of awareness, don222t make dema
nds. It222s more like obeying the traffic 
rules. If you don222t observe traffic rules, you 
pay the penalty. Here in the United States 
you drive on the right side of the road; in
 England you drive on the left; in India you 
drive on the left. If you don222t, you pay the penalty; there is no room for hurt feelings or 
demands or expectations; you just
 abide by the traffic rules.  You ask where compassion comes in, where guilt comes in in all this. You222ll know 
when you222re awake. If you222re feeling guilty 
right now, how on earth can I explain it to 
you? How would you know what compassion is? You know, sometimes people want to 
imitate Christ, but when a monkey plays a saxophone, that doesn222t make him a musician. 
You can222t imitate Christ by imitating his external
 behavior. You222ve got to be Christ. Then 
you222ll know exactly what to do in a particul
ar situation, given your temperament, your 
character, and the character and temperament 
of the person you222re dealing with. No one   45  has to tell you. But to do that, you must 
be
 what Christ was. An external imitation will 
get you nowhere. If you think th
at compassion implies softness, there222s no way I can 
describe compassion to you, absolutely no way, because compassion can be very hard. 
Compassion can be very rude, compassi
on can jolt you, compassion can roll up its 
sleeves and operate on you. Compassion is all 
kinds of things. Compassion can be very 
soft, but there222s no way of knowing that. It
222s only when you become love227in other 
words, when you have dropped your illusion
s and attachments227that you will 223know.224  As you identify less and less with the 223I
,224 you will be more at ease with everybody 
and with everything. Do you know why? Beca
use you are no longer afraid of being hurt 
or not liked. You no longer desire to impre
ss anyone. Can you imagine the relief when 
you don222t have to impress anybody anymore? Oh
, what a relief. Happiness at last! You 
no longer feel the need or the compulsion to ex
plain things anymore. 
It222s all right. What 
is there to be explained? And you don222t f
eel the need or compulsion to apologize 
anymore. I222d much rather hear you say, 223I222v
e come awake,224 than hear you say, 223I222m 
sorry.224 I222d much rather hear you say to me, 
223I222ve come awake since we last met; what I 
did to you won222t happen again,224 than to hear
 you say, 223I222m so sorry for what I did to 
you.224 Why would anyone demand an apology? Y
ou have something to explore in that. 
Even when someone supposedly was mean
 to you, there is no room for apology.  Nobody was mean to you. Somebody was mean to what he or she thought was you, 
but not to you. Nobody ever reje
cts you; they222re only rejecting what they think you are. 
But that cuts both ways. Nobody ever accepts you either. Until people come awake, they 
are simply accepting or rejecting their image 
of you. They222ve fashioned an image of you, 
and they222re rejecting or accepting that. See how
 devastating it is to 
go deeply into that. 
It222s a bit too liberating. But how easy it is 
to love people when you understand this. How 
easy it is to love everyone when you don222t id
entify with what they imagine you are or 
they are. It becomes easy to love them, to love everybody.  I observe 223me,224 but I do not think about 
223me.224 Because the thinking 223me224 does a lot 
of bad thinking, too. But when I watch 223me,224 
I am constantly aware that this is a 
reflection. In reality, you don222t really think of
 223I224 and 223me.224 You222re
 like a person driving 
the car; he doesn222t ever want to lose consci
ousness of the car. It222s 
all right to daydream, 
but not to lose consciousness 
of your surroundings. You must al
ways be alert. It222s like a 
mother sleeping; she doesn222t hear the planes
 roaring above the hous
e, but she hears the 
slightest whimper of her baby. She222s alert, 
she222s awake in that sense. One cannot say 
anything about the awakened state; one can onl
y talk about the sleep
ing state. One hints 
at the awakened state. One cannot say a
nything about happiness. Happiness cannot be 
defined. What can be defined is misery. Drop unhappiness and you will know. Love 
cannot be defined; unlove can. Drop unlove, dr
op fear, and you will know. We want to 
find out what the awakened person is like.
 But you222ll know only when you get there.  Am I implying, for example, that we shouldn222t make demands on our children? 
What I said was: 223You don222t have a right to
 make any demands.224 Sooner or later that 
child is going to have to get rid of you, in 
keeping with the injunc
tion of the Lord. And 
you222re going to have no rights over him at all.
 In fact, he really isn222t your child and he 
never was. He belongs to life, not to you. 
No one belongs to you. What you222re talking 
about is a child222s education. If you want l
unch, you better come in
 between twelve and 
one or you don222t get lunch. Period. That222s th
e way things are run here. You don222t come 
on time, you don222t get your lunch. You222re fr
ee, that true, but you must take the   46  consequences.  When I talk about not having expectations of others, or not making demands on 
them, I mean expectations and demands for my well-being. The President of the United 
States obviously has to make demands on pe
ople. The traffic policeman obviously has to 
make demands on people. But these are demands on their behavior227traffic laws, good 
organization, the smooth running of society. Th
ey are not intended to
 make the President 
or traffic policeman feel good.      ARRIVING AT SILENCE    Everyone asks me about what will happen wh
en they finally arrive. Is this just 
curiosity? We222re always asking ho
w would this fit into that sy
stem, or whether this would 
make sense in that context, or what it will feel like when we get there. Get started and 
you will know; it cannot be described. It is 
said widely in the East, 223Those who know, do 
not say; those who say, do not know.224 It ca
nnot be said; only the opposite can be said. 
The guru cannot give you the truth. Truth cannot 
be put into words, into a formula. That 
isn222t the truth. That isn222t reality. Reality canno
t be put into a formula. The guru can only 
point out your errors. When you drop your errors, you will know the truth. And even then 
you cannot say. This is common teaching among 
the great Catholic mystics. The great 
Thomas Aquinas, toward the end of his lif
e, wouldn222t write and 
wouldn222t talk; he had 
seen. I had thought he kept that famous sile
nce of his for only a c
ouple of months, but it 
went on for years. He realized he had made a 
fool of himself, and he said so explicitly. 
It222s as if you had never ta
sted a green mango and you ask me, 223What does it taste like?224 
I222d say to you, 223Sour,224 but in giving you a 
word, I222ve put you off the track. Try to 
understand that. Most people aren222t very wi
se; they seize upon the word227upon the words 
of scripture, for example227and they get it
 all wrong. 223Sour,224 I say, and you ask, 223Sour 
like vinegar, sour like a lemon?224 No, not sour
 like a lemon, but sour like a mango. 223But I 
never tasted one,224 you say. Too bad! But you go ahead and write a doctoral thesis on it. 
You wouldn222t have if you had tasted it. Y
ou really wouldn222t. You222d have written a 
doctoral thesis on other things, but not on ma
ngoes. And the day you finally taste a green 
mango, you say, 223God, I made a fool
 of myself. I shouldn222t have
 written that thesis.224 
That222s exactly what Thomas Aquinas did.  A great German philosopher and theologian
 wrote a whole book specifically on the 
silence of St. Thomas. He simply went sile
nt. Wouldn222t talk. In the prologue of his 
Summa Theologica
, which was the summary of all his theology, he says, 223About God, we 
cannot say what He is but rather what He is 
not. And so we cannot speak about how He is 
but rather how He is not.224 And in his famous commentary on Boethius222 
De Sancta 
Trinitate
 he says there are three ways of knowi
ng God: (1) in the creation, (2) in God222s 
actions through history, and (3) in the highe
st form of the knowledge of God227to know 
God tamquam ignotum
 (to know God as the unknown). The 
highest form of talking about 
the Trinity is to know that one
 does not know. Now, this is not an Oriental Zen master 
speaking. This is a canonized saint of th
e Roman Catholic Church, the prince of 
theologians for centuries. To know God as 
unknown. In another place St. Thomas even 
says: as unknowable. Reality, God, divinity, tr
uth, love are unknowable; that means they 
cannot be comprehended by the thinking mind. Th
at would set at rest
 so many questions   47  people have because we222re always living unde
r the illusion that we know. We don222t. We 
cannot know.  What is scripture, then? It
222s a hint, a clue, not a desc
ription. The fanaticism of one 
sincere believer who thinks he knows causes 
more evil than the un
ited efforts of two 
hundred rogues. It222s terrifying to see what sincere believers will do because they think 
they know. Wouldn222t it be wonde
rful if we had a world where everybody said, 223We don222t 
know224? One big barrier dropped. 
Wouldn222t that be marvelous?  A man born blind comes to me and asks, 223What is this thing called green?224 How 
does one describe the color gr
een to someone who was born b
lind? One uses analogies. 
So I say, 223The color green is something like so
ft music.224 223Oh,224 he says, 223like soft music.224 
223Yes,224 I say, 223soothing and soft music.224 So a second blind man comes to me and asks, 
223What is the color green?224 I tell him it222s some
thing like soft satin, very soft and soothing 
to the touch. So the next da
y I notice that the two blind me
n are bashing each other over 
the head with bottles. One is saying, 223It222s soft
 like music224; the other is saying, 223It222s soft 
like satin.224 And on it goes. Neither of them kno
ws what they222re talking about, because if 
they did, they222d shut up. It222s as bad as th
at. It222s even worse, because one day, say, you 
give sight to this blind man, and he222s sitt
ing there in the garden and he222s looking all 
around him, and you say to him, 223Well, now 
you know what the color green is.224 And he 
answers, 223That222s true. I heard some of it this morning!224  The fact is that you222re surrounded by God and you don222t see God, because you 
223know224 about God. The final barrier to the vi
sion of God is your God concept. You miss 
God because you think you know. That222s the terrib
le thing about religion. That222s what the 
gospels were saying, that religious people 223kne
w,224 so they got rid of Jesus. The highest 
knowledge of God is to know God as unknowable. There is far too much God talk; the 
world is sick of it. There is 
too little awareness, too little 
love, too little happiness, but 
let222s not use those words either. There222s t
oo little dropping of illusions, dropping of 
errors, dropping of attachments 
and cruelty, too little
 awareness. That222s what the world is 
suffering from, not from a lack of religion. Re
ligion is supposed to be about a lack of 
awareness, of waking up. Look what we222ve de
generated into. Come to my country and 
see them killing one another over religion. 
You222ll find it everywhere. 223The one who 
knows, does not say; the one who says, does not
 know.224 All revelations, however divine, 
are never any more than a finger pointing to 
the moon. As we say in the East, 223When the 
sage points to the moon, all th
e idiot sees is the finger.224  Jean Guiton, a very pious and orthodox Fr
ench writer, adds 
a terrifying comment: 
223We often use the finger to gouge eyes out.224 
Isn222t that terrible? Awareness, awareness, 
awareness! In awareness is hea
ling; in awareness is truth; in
 awareness is salvation; in 
awareness is spirituality; in awareness is grow
th; in awareness is love; in awareness is 
awakening. Awareness.  I need to talk about words and concepts because I must explain to you why it is, 
when we look at a tree, we really don222t see. We 
think
 we do, but we don222t. When we look 
at a person, we really don222t 
see that person, we only thi
nk we do. What we222re seeing is 
something that we fixed in our mind. We 
get an impression and we hold on to that 
impression, and we keep looking at a pers
on through that impression. And we do this 
with almost everything. If you understand that, you will understand the loveliness and 
beauty of being aware of everything ar
ound you. Because reality is there; 223God,224 
whatever that is, is there. It222s all 
there
. The poor little fish in the ocean says, 223Excuse me,   48  I222m looking for the ocean. Can you tell me where 
I can find it?224 Pathetic, isn222t it? If we 
would just open our eyes and see, then we would understand.      LOSING THE RAT RACE    Let222s get back to that marvelous sentence 
in the gospel about losing oneself in order 
to find oneself. One finds it in most religious 
literature and in all religious and spiritual 
and mystical literature.  How does one lose oneself? Did you ever 
try
 to lose something? That222s right, the 
harder you try, the harder it gets. It222s when you222re not trying that you lose things. You 
lose something when you222re not aware. Well,
 how does one die to oneself? We222re talking 
about death now, we222re not talking about suicid
e. We222re not told to 
kill the self
, but to 
die. Causing pain to the self, causing sufferi
ng to the self would be self-defeating. It 
would be counterproductive. You222re never so 
full of yourself as when you222re in pain. 
You222re never so centered on yourself as when 
you222re depressed. You222re never so ready to 
forget yourself as when you are happy. Happine
ss releases you from self. It is suffering 
and pain and misery and depression that ti
e you to the self. Look how conscious you are 
of your tooth when you have a toothache. 
When you don222t have a toothache, you222re not 
even aware you have a tooth, or that you ha
ve a head, for that matter, when you don222t 
have a headache. But it222s so different when you have a splitting headache.  So it222s quite false, quite err
oneous, to think that the way to
 deny the self is to cause 
pain to the self, to go in for abnegation, 
mortification, as these were traditionally 
understood. To deny the self, to die to it, to lose
 it, is to understand its true nature. When 
you do that, it will disappear; it will vanish. 
Suppose somebody walks into my room one 
day. I say, 223Come right in. May I know who 
you are?224 And he says
, 223I am Napoleon.224 
And I say, 223Not the Napoleon . . .224 And he says, 223Precisely. Bonaparte, Emperor of 
France.224 223What do you know!224 I say, even while I222m thinking to myself, 223I better handle 
this guy with care.224  223Sit down, Your Majesty,224 I say. 223Well, they tell me you222re a pretty good spiritual 
director. I have a spiritual problem. I222m a
nxious, I222m finding it hard to trust in God. I 
have my armies in Russia, see, and I222
m spending sleepless nights wondering how it222s 
going to turn out.224 So I say, 223Well, Your Ma
jesty, I could certainly prescribe something 
for that. What I suggest is that you read chap
ter 6 of Matthew: 223Consider the lilies of the 
field . . . they neither toil nor spin.224  By this point I222m wondering who is crazier,
 this guy or me. But I go along with this 
lunatic. That222s what the wise guru does w
ith you in the beginning. He goes along with 
you; he takes your troubles seriously. He222ll wi
pe a tear or two from your eye. You222re 
crazy, but you don222t know it yet. The time has 
to come soon when he222ll pull the rug out 
from under your feet and tell you, 223Get off 
it, you222re not Napoleon.224 In those famous 
dialogues of St. Catherine of Sien
a, God is reported to have said
 to her, 223I am He who is; 
you are she who is not.224 Have you ever experienced your is-not-ness? In the East we 
have an image for this. It is the image of th
e dancer and the dance. 
God is viewed as the 
dancer and creation as God222s da
nce. It isn222t as if God is 
the big dancer and you are the 
little dancer. Oh no. You222re not
 a dancer at all. You are 
being
 danced! Did you ever 
experience that? So when the man comes to 
his senses and realizes that he is not   49  Napoleon, he does not cease to be. He continues 
to be, but he suddenly realizes that he is 
something other than what he thought he was.  To lose the self is to suddenly realiz
e that you are something other than what you 
thought you were. You thought you were at the center; now 
you experience yourself as 
satellite. You thought you were
 the dancer; you now experience yourself as the dance. 
These are just analogies, images, so you cannot 
take them literally. They just give you a 
clue, a hint; they222re only pointers, don222t 
forget. So you cannot press them too much. 
Don222t take them too literally.      PERMANENT WORTH    To move on to another idea, there is 
the whole matter of one222s personal worth. 
Personal worth doesn222t mean self-worth. Wh
ere do you get self-worth from? Do you get 
it from success in your work? Do you get it 
from having a lot of money? Do you get it 
from attracting a lot of men (if you222re a woman) or a lot of women (if you222re a man)? 
How fragile all that is, how transitory. When 
we talk about self-wor
th, are we not talking, 
really, about how we are reflected in the mi
rrors of other people222s minds? But do we need 
to depend on that? One understands one222s pe
rsonal worth when one no longer identifies 
or defines one222s self in terms of these tran
sient things. I222m not beautiful because everyone 
says I222m beautiful. I222m really neither beautif
ul nor ugly. These are things that come and 
go. I could be suddenly transformed into a very 
ugly creature tomorrow, but it is still 223I.224 
Then, say, I get plastic surgery and I become 
beautiful again. Does the 223I224 really become 
beautiful? You need to give a lot of time to
 reflect on these things. I222ve thrown them at 
you in rapid succession, but if you would take 
the time to understand what I have been 
saying, to dwell on it, you222ll have a gold mine
 there. I know, because when I stumbled 
upon these things for the first time, what a treasure I discovered.  Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth. 
Pleasant experiences make life delightful, but 
they don222t lead to growth in themselves. 
What leads to growth is painful experience
s. Suffering points up an area in you where 
you have not yet grown, where you need to grow
 and be transformed and change. If you 
knew how to use that suffering, oh, how you wo
uld grow. Let222s limit ourselves, for the 
time being, to psychological suffering, to all those negative emotions we have. Don222t 
waste your time on a single one of them. I222v
e already told you what you could do with 
those emotions. The disappointment you experience when things don222t turn out as you 
wanted them to, watch that! Look at what
 it says about you. I say this without 
condemnation (otherwise you222re going to get 
caught up in self-hatred). Observe it as you 
would observe it in another person. 
Look
 at that disappointme
nt, that depression you 
experience when you are criticize
d. What does that say about you?  Have you heard about the fellow who said, 223W
ho says that worry doesn222t help? It 
certainly does help. Every time I worry a
bout something it doesn222t happen!224 Well, it 
certainly helped 
him
. Or the other fellow who says, 
223The neurotic is a person who 
worries about something that did not happen 
in the past. He222s not like us normal people 
who worry about things that will not happen in the future.224 That222s the issue. That worry, 
that anxiety, what does it say about you?  Negative feelings, every negative feeling is useful for 
awareness, for understanding.   50  They give you the opportunity to
 feel it, to watch it from 
the outside. In the beginning, 
the depression will still be there, but you will have cut your
 connection with it. Gradually 
you will understand the depression. As you unders
tand it, it will occur less frequently, 
and will disappear altogether. Maybe, but by 
that time it won222t matter too much. Before 
enlightenment I used to be depressed. After 
enlightenment I continue to be depressed. 
But gradually, or rapidly, or suddenly, you get th
e state of wakefulness. This is the state 
where you drop desires. But remember what 
I meant by desire and cravings. I meant: 
223Unless I get what I desire, I refuse to be happy.224 I mean cases where happiness depends 
on the fulfillment of desire.      DESIRE, NOT PREFERENCE    Do not suppress desire, because then you w
ould become lifeless. You222d be without 
energy and that would be terrible. Desi
re in the healthy 
sense of the word 
is
 energy, and 
the more energy we have, the better. But 
don222t suppress desire, understand it. Understand 
it. Don222t seek to fulfill desire so much 
as to understand desire. And don222t just renounce 
the objects of your desire, understand them; s
ee them in their true light. See them for 
what they are really worth. Because if you ju
st suppress your desire, and you attempt to 
renounce the object of your 
desire, you are likely to be tied
 to it. Whereas if you look at it 
and see it for what it is really worth, if
 you understand how you are preparing the grounds 
for misery and disappointment and depression, 
your desire will then be transformed into 
what I call a preference.  When you go through life with preferen
ces but don222t let your happiness depend on 
any one of them, then you222re awake. You222re moving toward wakefulness. Wakefulness, 
happiness227call it what you wish227is the state 
of nondelusion, where you see things not 
as 
you
 are but as 
they
 are, insofar as this is possible 
for a human being. To drop illusions, 
to see things, to see real
ity. Every time you are unhappy, you have added something to 
reality. It is that addition that makes 
you unhappy. I repeat: You have added something... 
a negative reaction in you. Reality provides the stimulus, you provide the reaction. You 
have added something by your reaction. And if
 you examine what you have added, there 
is always an illusion there, there222s a demand, an expectation, a craving. Always. 
Examples of illusions abound. But as you begin to move ahead on this path, you222ll 
discover them for yourself.  For instance, the illusion, the error of th
inking that, by changing the exterior world, 
you
 will change. You do not change if you merely
 change your exterior world. If you get 
yourself a new job or a new spouse or a ne
w home or a new guru or a new spirituality, 
that does not change 
you
. It222s like imagining that y
ou change your handwriting by 
changing your pen. Or that you change your cap
acity to think by changing your hat. That 
doesn222t change you really, but most people spen
d all their energies 
trying to rearrange 
their exterior world to suit th
eir tastes. Sometimes they su
cceed227for about five minutes 
and they get a little respite, but they are tens
e even during that resp
ite, because life is 
always flowing, life is always changing.  So if you want to live, you must have 
no permanent abode. You must have no place 
to rest your head. You have to flow with it.
 As the great Confucius said, 223The one who 
would be constant in happiness must fre
quently change.224 Flow. But we keep looking   51  back, don222t we? We cling to things in the past
 and cling to things in the present. 223When 
you set your hand to the plow, you cannot look 
back.224 Do you want to enjoy a melody? 
Do you want to enjoy a symphony? Don222t hold on
 to a few bars of the music. Don222t hold 
on to a couple of notes. Let them pass, 
let them flow. The whole enjoyment of a 
symphony lies in your readiness to allow the not
es to pass. Whereas if a particular bar 
took your fancy and you shouted to the orches
tra, 223Keep playing it again and again and 
again,224 that wouldn222t be a symphony anymore. 
Are you familiar with those tales of Nasr-
ed-Din, the old mullah? He222s a legendary fi
gure whom the Greeks, Turks, and Persians 
all claim for themselves. He would give his mystical teachings in the form of stories, 
generally funny stories. And the butt of the 
story was always old 
Nasr-ed-Din himself.  One day Nasr-ed-Din was strumming a guitar, playing just one note. After a while a 
crowd collected around him (this was in a market
place) and one of th
e men sitting on the 
ground there said, 223That222s a ni
ce note you222re playing, Mullah, 
but why don222t you vary it a 
bit the way other musicians do?224 223Thos
e fools,224 Nasr-ed-Din said, 223they222re 
searching
 for 
the right note. I222ve 
found
 it.      CLINGING TO ILLUSION    When you cling, life is destroyed; when 
you hold on to anything, you cease to live. 
It222s all over the gospel pages. And one
 attains this by understanding. Understand. 
Understand another illusion, too, th
at happiness is not the same 
as excitement, it222s not the 
same as thrills. That222s another illusion, that 
a thrill comes from living a desire fulfilled. 
Desire breeds anxiety and sooner or later 
it brings its hangover. When you222ve suffered 
sufficiently, then you are ready to see it. You222re
 feeding yourself with thrills. This is like 
feeding a racehorse with de
licacies. You222re giving it cakes
 and wine. You don222t feed a 
racehorse like that. It222s like feeding hu
man beings with drugs. You don222t fill your 
stomach with drugs. You need good, solid, nutritious food and drink. You need to 
understand all this
 for yourself.  Another illusion is that some
one else can do this for you, that some savior or guru or 
teacher can do this for you. Not even the greate
st guru in the world can take a single step 
for you. You222ve got to take it you
rself. St. Augustine said it so marvelously: 223Jesus Christ 
himself could do nothing for many 
of his hearers.224 Or to repeat
 that lovely Arab saying: 
223The nature of the rain is the same and yet it
 produces thorns in the marsh and flowers in 
the garden.224 It is 
you
 who have to do it. No one else can help you. It is 
you
 who have to 
digest your food, it is 
you
 who have to understand. No one
 else can understand for you. It 
is 
you
 who have to seek. Nobody can seek for 
you. And if what you seek is truth, then 
you
 must do this. You can lean on no one.  There is yet another illusion, that it is impor
tant to be respectable, to be loved and 
appreciated, to be important. Many say we 
have a natural urge to be loved and 
appreciated, to belong. That222s false. Drop th
is illusion and you will find happiness. We 
have a natural urge to be free, 
a natural urge to love, but not 
to be loved
. Sometimes in 
my psychotherapy sessions I encounter a 
very common problem: Nobody loves me; how, 
then, can I be happy? I explain to him or 
her: 223You mean you never have any moments 
when you forget you222re not loved and you let 
go and are happy?224 Of course they have.  A woman, for example, is absorbed in a m
ovie. It222s a comedy and she222s roaring with   52  laughter and in that blessed moment she222s 
forgotten to remind herself that nobody loves 
her, nobody loves her, nobody loves her. She222s 
happy! Then she comes out of the theater 
and her friend whom she saw the movie w
ith goes off with a boyfriend, leaving the 
woman all alone. So she starts thinking, 223All 
my friends have boyfriends and I have no 
one. I222m so unhappy. Nobody loves me!
224  In India, many of our poor people are star
ting to get transistor
 radios, which are 
quite a luxury. 223Everybody has a 
transistor,224 you hear, 223but I 
don222t have a transistor; I222m 
so unhappy.224 Until everyone started getting tr
ansistors, they were perfectly happy 
without one. That222s the way it is with
 you. Until somebody told you you wouldn222t be 
happy unless you were loved, you were perf
ectly happy. You can become happy not 
being loved, not being desired by or attractive to someone
. You become happy by contact 
with reality. That222s what br
ings happiness, a moment-by-
moment contact with reality. 
That222s where you222ll find God; that222s where 
you222ll find happiness. But 
most people are not 
ready to hear that.  Another illusion is that exte
rnal events have the power to hurt you, that other people 
have the power to hurt you. They don222t. It
222s you who give this power to them.  Another illusion: You 
are
 all those labels that people have put on you, or that you 
have put on yourself. You222re not, you222re not! So you don222t have to cling to them. The day 
that somebody tells me I222m a genius and I take
 that seriously, I222m in
 big trouble. Can you 
understand why? Because now I222m going to start 
getting tense. I222ve got to live up to it, 
I222ve got to maintain it. I222ve got to find out af
ter every lecture: 223Did
 you like the lecture? 
Do you still think I222m a genius?224 See? So wh
at you need to do is smash the label! Smash 
it, and you222re free! Don222t iden
tify with those labels. That222s
 what someone else thinks. 
That222s how 
he
 experienced you at that moment. Ar
e you in fact a genius? Are you a nut? 
Are you a mystic? Are you crazy? What does it r
eally matter? Provided you continue to 
be aware, to live life 
from moment to moment. How marv
elously it is described in those 
words of the gospel: 223Look at the birds of the 
air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather 
into barns ... Consider the lilies of the field . . . they neither 
toil nor spin.224 That222s the real 
mystic speaking, the awakened person.  So why are you anxious? Can you, for all your anxieties, add a single moment to 
your life? Why bother about tomorrow? Is ther
e a life after death? 
Will I survive after 
death? Why bother about tomorrow? 
Get into today
. Someone said, 223Life is something 
that happens to us while we222re busy making ot
her plans.224 That222s pathetic. Live in the 
present moment. This is one of the thi
ngs you will notice happening to you as you come 
awake. You find yourself living in the pres
ent, tasting every mo
ment as you live it. 
Another fairly good sign is when you hear 
the symphony one note afte
r the other without 
wanting to stop it.      HUGGING MEMORIES    That brings me to another theme, another t
opic. But this new topic ties in very much 
with what I222ve been saying and with my s
uggestion of becoming awar
e of all the things 
we add to reality. Let222s take
 this one step at a time.  A Jesuit was telling me the other day how 
years ago he gave a talk in New York, 
where Puerto Ricans were very unpopular at
 the time because of some incident.   53  Everybody was saying all kinds of things against 
them. So in his talk he said, 223Let me 
read to you some of the things that the pe
ople in New York were
 saying about certain 
immigrants.224 What he read to them was actua
lly what people had said about the Irish, and 
about the Germans, and about every other wave of immigrants that had come to New 
York years before! He put it very well 
when he said, 223These people don222t bring 
delinquency with them; they become deli
nquent when they222re faced with certain 
situations here. We222ve got to understand them. If you want to cure
 the situation, it222s 
useless reacting from prejudice. You need
 understanding, not condemnation.224 That is 
how you bring about change in yourself. No
t by condemnation, not by calling yourself 
names, but by understanding what222s going on. 
Not by calling yourself a dirty old sinner. 
No, no, no, no!  In order to get awareness, you222ve got to 
see, and you can222t s
ee if you222re prejudiced. 
Almost everything and every person we look at
, we look at in a prejudiced way. It222s 
almost enough to dishearten anybody.  Like meeting a long-lost friend. 223Hey, To
m,224 I say, 223It222s good to see you,224 and I 
give him a big hug. Whom am I hugging, Tom or
 my memory of him? A living human 
being or a corpse? I222m assuming that he222s still the attractive guy 
I thought he was. I222m 
assuming he still fits in with the idea 
I have of him and with my memories and 
associations. So I give him a hug. Five minutes
 later I find that he222s changed and I have 
no more interest in him. I hugged the wrong person.  If you want to see how true this is, listen
: A religious sister from India goes out to 
make a retreat. Everybody in the community 
is saying, 223Oh, we know, that222s part of her 
charism; she222s always attending workshops 
and going to retreats; nothing will ever 
change her.224 Now, it so happens that the sister does change at this particular workshop, or 
therapy group, or whatever it is. She change
s; everyone notices the 
difference. Everyone 
says, 223My, you222ve really come to some insigh
ts, haven222t you?224 She has, and they can see 
the difference in her behavior, in her body, in
 her face. You always do when there222s an 
inner change. It always regist
ers in your face, in your eyes, in your body. Well, the sister 
goes back to her community, and since the co
mmunity has a prejudiced, fixed idea about 
her, they222re going to continue to
 look at her through the eyes
 of that prejudice. They222re 
the only ones who don222t see any change in her. They say, 223Oh well, she seems a little 
more spirited, but just wait, she222ll be depressed again.224 And within a few weeks she 
is
 
depressed again; she222s reacting to their reac
tion. And they all say, 223See, we told you so; 
she hadn222t changed.224 But the tragedy is that 
she had, only they didn222t see it. Perception 
has devastating consequences in the ma
tter of love and human relationships.  Whatever a relationship may be, it certainly entails two things: clarity of perception 
(inasmuch as we222re capable of it; some people would dispute to what extent we can attain 
clarity of perception, but I don222t 
think anyone would dispute that
 it is desirable that we 
move toward it) and accuracy of response. 
You222re more likely to respond accurately 
when you perceive clearly. When your perc
eption is distorted, 
you222re not likely to 
respond accurately. How can you love some
one whom you do not even see? Do you 
really see someone you222re att
ached to? Do you really see so
meone you222re afraid of and 
therefore dislike? We always hate what we fear.  223The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
 wisdom,224 people say to me sometimes. But 
wait a minute. I hope they understand what they222re saying, because we always hate what 
we fear. We always want to destroy and get rid of and avoid what we fear. When you fear   54  somebody, you dislike that person. You dislik
e that person insofar as you fear that 
person. And you don222t 
see
 that person either, because your
 emotion gets in the way. Now, 
that222s just as true when you are attracted to someone. When true love enters, you no 
longer like or even dislike peopl
e in the ordinary sense of th
e word. You see them clearly 
and you respond accurately. But at this human level, your likes and dislikes and 
preferences and attractio
ns, etc., continue to get in the way. So you have to be aware of 
your prejudices, your likes, your dislikes, your 
attractions. They222re a
ll there, they come 
from your conditioning. How come you like thin
gs that I don222t like? Because your culture 
is different from mine. Your 
upbringing is different from mine
. If I gave you some of the 
things to eat that I relish, 
you222d turn away in disgust.  There are people in certain parts of Indi
a who love dog flesh. Yet others, if they 
were told they were being served dog 
steak, would feel sick. Why? Different 
conditioning, different programming. Hindus would feel sick if they knew they had eaten 
beef, but Americans enjoy it. You ask, 223But 
why won222t they eat beef?224 For the same 
reason you won222t eat your pet dog. The same reas
on. The cow, to the Indian peasant, is 
what your pet dog is to you. He doesn222t want
 to eat it. There is
 a built-in cultural 
prejudice against it which save
s an animal that222s needed so much for farming, etc.  So why do I fall in love with a person real
ly? Why is it that I fall in love with one 
kind of person and not another? Because I222m conditioned. I222ve got an image, 
subconsciously, that this partic
ular type of person appeals to
 me, attracts me. So when I 
meet this person, I fall head over heels in love. But have I seen her? No! I222ll see her after 
I marry her; that222s when the awakening co
mes! And that222s when love may begin. But 
falling in love has nothing to do with love at all. It isn222t love, it222s desire, burning desire. 
You want, with all your heart, to be told by this adorable crea
ture that you222re attractive to 
her. That gives you a tremendous sensation. Meanwhile, everybody else is saying, 223What 
the hell does he see in her?224 
But it222s his conditioning227he222s not 
seeing
. They say that 
love is blind. Believe me, there222s nothing so 
clear-sighted as true 
love, nothing. It222s the 
most clear-sighted thing in th
e world. Addiction is blind, a
ttachments are blind. Clinging, 
craving, and desire are blind. Bu
t not true love. Don222t call them
 love. But, of course, the 
word has been desecrated in most modern 
languages. People talk about making love and 
falling in love. Like the little
 boy who says to the little girl, 223Have you ever fallen in 
love?224 And she answers,
 223No, but I222ve fallen in 
like
.224  So what are people talking about when they fall in love? The first thing we need is 
clarity of perception. One reason we don222t 
perceive people clear
ly is evident227our 
emotions get in the way, our conditioning, our 
likes and dislikes. We222ve got to grapple 
with that fact. But we222ve got to grapple with something much more fundamental227with 
our ideas, with our conclusions, with our con
cepts. Believe it or not, every concept that 
was meant to help us get in touch with real
ity ends up by being a barrier to getting in 
touch with reality, because sooner or later we 
forget that the words are not the thing. The 
concept is not the same as th
e reality. They222re different. Th
at222s why I said to you earlier 
that the final barrier to finding God is the 
word 223God224 itself and the concept of God. It 
gets in the way if you222re not careful. It was m
eant to be a help; it can
 be a help, but it can 
also be a barrier.         55  GETTING CONCRETE    Every time I have a concept, it is some
thing that I could apply to a number of 
individuals. We222re not talking 
about a concrete, particular 
name like Mary or John, which 
doesn222t have a conceptual meaning. A concep
t applies to any number of individuals, 
countless individuals. Concepts 
are universal. For instance, 
the word 223leaf224 could be 
applied to every single leaf on a tree; the same word applies 
to all those individual leaves. 
Moreover, the same word applies to all the 
leaves on all trees, big ones, small ones, 
tender ones, dried ones, yellow ones, green ones,
 banana leaves. So if
 I say to you that I 
saw a leaf this morning, you really d
on222t have an idea of what I saw.  Let222s see if you can understand that. You 
do have an idea of what I did 
not
 see. I did 
not see an animal. I did not see a dog. I did 
not see a human being. I did not see a shoe. 
So you have some kind of a vague idea of what 
I saw, but it isn222t pa
rticularized, it isn222t 
concrete. 223Human being224 refers not to primitive man, not to civilized man, not to 
grownup man, not to a child, not 
to a male or a female, not to this particular age or 
another, not to this culture 
or the other, but to the con
cept. The human being is found 
concrete; you never find a universal human 
being like your concept.
 So your concept 
points, but it is never entirely accurate; it 
misses uniqueness, concreteness. The concept is 
universal.  When I give you a concept, I give you 
something
, and yet how little I have given 
you. The concept is so valuable, so useful for 
science. For instance, if I say that everyone 
here is an animal, that would be perfectly 
accurate from a scientific viewpoint. But we222re 
something more than animals. If I say that 
Mary Jane is an animal, that222s true; but 
because I222ve omitted something essential about her, it222s false; it does her an injustice. 
When I call a person a woman, that222s true; but th
ere are lots of things in that person that 
don222t fit into the con
cept 223woman.224 She is always th
is particular, concrete, unique 
woman, who can only be experienced, not conc
eptualized. The concrete person I222ve got 
to see for myself, to experience for myself, to intuit for myself. The individual can be 
intuited but cannot be conceptualized.  A person is beyond the thinking mind. Many 
of you would probably be proud to be 
called Americans, as many Indians would proba
bly be proud to be called Indians. But 
what is 223American,224 what is 223I
ndian224? It222s a convention; it222s
 not part of your nature. All 
you222ve got is a label. You really don222t know
 the person. The concept always misses or 
omits something extremely important, somethi
ng precious that is only found in reality, 
which is concrete uniqueness. The great Kris
hnamurti put it so well when he said, 223The 
day you teach the child the name of the bird, 
the child will never s
ee that bird again.224 
How true! The first time the child sees that
 fluffy, alive, moving object, and you say to 
him, Sparrow,224 then tomorrow when the child 
sees another fluffy, 
moving object similar 
to it he says, 223Oh, sparrows. I222ve seen sparrows. I222m 
bored
 by sparrows.224  If you don222t look at things through your 
concepts, you222ll never be bored. Every 
single thing is unique. Every sparrow is 
unlike every other sparrow despite the 
similarities. It222s a great help to have similariti
es, so we can abstract, so that we can have a 
concept. It222s a great help, fr
om the point of view of co
mmunication, education, science. 
But it222s also very misleading 
and a great hindrance to seeing 
this
 concrete individual. If 
all you experience is your concept, you222re 
not experiencing reality, because reality is 
concrete. The concept is a help, to 
lead
 you to reality, but when you get there, you222ve got   56  to intuit or experience it directly.   A second quality of a concept is that it is st
atic whereas reality is in flux. We use the 
same name for Niagara Falls, 
but that body of water is constantly changing. You222ve got 
the word 223river,224 but the water there is cons
tantly flowing. You222ve got one word for your 
223body,224 but the cells in your body are consta
ntly being renewed. Let222s suppose, for 
example, there is an enormous wind outside a
nd I want the people in my country to get an 
idea of what an American gale or hurricane is
 like. So I capture it in a cigar box and I go 
back home and say, 223Look at this.224 Naturally, it
 isn222t a gale anymore, is it? Once it222s 
captured
. Or if I want you to get the feel of what 
the flow of a river is
 like and I bring it 
to you in a bucket. The moment I put it into 
a bucket it has stopped flowing. The moment 
you put things into a concept, they stop flowing; they become static, dead. A frozen wave 
is not a wave. A wave is essentially movement, action; when you freeze it, it is not a 
wave. Concepts are always frozen. Reality flows. Finally, if we are to believe the mystics 
(and it doesn222t take too much of an effort to
 understand this, or even 
believe it, but no one 
can see it at once), reality is 
whole, but words and concepts 
fragment
 reality. That is why 
it is so difficult to translate from one langua
ge to another, because each language cuts 
reality up differently. The English word 223home224 
is impossible to translate into French or 
Spanish. 223Casa224
 is not quite 223home224; 223home224 has asso
ciations that are peculiar to the 
English language. Every language has untrans
latable words and expressions, because 
we222re cutting reality up and adding something 
or subtracting something and usage keeps 
changing. Reality is a whole and we cut it 
up to make concepts and we use words to 
indicate different parts. If you had never seen 
an animal in your life, for example, and one 
day you found a tail227just a tail227and some
body told you, 223That222s a tail,224 would you 
have any idea of what it was if you had no idea what an animal was?  Ideas actually fragment the vi
sion, intuition, or e
xperience of reality as a whole. This 
is what the mystics are perpetually telling 
us. Words cannot give you reality. They only 
point, they only indicate. You use them as 
pointers to get to reality. But once you get 
there, your concepts are useless. A Hindu pr
iest once had a dispute with a philosopher 
who claimed that the final barrier to God 
was the word 223God,224 the concept of God. The 
priest was quite shocked by this, but the philo
sopher said, 223The ass that you mount 227and 
that you use to travel to a house is not th
e means by which you enter the house. You use 
the concept to get there; then you dismount
, you go beyond it.224 You don222t need to be a 
mystic to understand that reality is some
thing that cannot be captured by words or 
concepts. To know reality you have to 
know beyond knowing
.  Do those words ring a bell? Those of you who are familiar with 
The Cloud of 
Unknowing would recognize the expression. Poets,
 painters, mystics, and the great 
philosophers all have intimations of its tr
uth. Let222s suppose that one day I222m watching a 
tree. Until now, every time I saw a tree, I 
said, 223Well, it222s a tree,224 But today when I222m 
looking at the tree, I don222t see a 
tree. At least I don222t see what I222m accustomed to seeing. I 
see something with the freshness of a child
222s vision. I have no word for it. I see 
something unique, whole, flowing, not fragmented. And I222m in awe. If you were to ask 
me, 223What did you see?224 what do you think I222d answer? I have no word for it. There is no 
word for reality. Because as soon as I put a wo
rd to it, we222re back 
into concepts again.  And if I cannot express this reality that
 is visible to my senses, how does one 
express what cannot be seen by the eye or 
heard by the ear? How does one find a word 
for the reality of God? Are you beginni
ng to understand what Thomas Aquinas,   57  Augustine, and all the rest were saying and wh
at the Church teaches constantly when she 
says that God is mystery, is uni
ntelligible to the human mind?  The great Karl Rahner, in one of his la
st letters, wrote to a young German drug 
addict who had asked him for help. The addict had said, 223You theologians talk about 
God, but how could this God be relevant in
 my life? How could this God get me off 
drugs?224 Rahner said to him, 223I must confess 
to you in all honesty that for me God is and 
has always been absolute my
stery. I do not understand what God is; no one can. We have 
intimations, inklings; we make 
faltering, inadequate attempts to put mystery into words. 
But there is no word for it, no sentence for it.
224 And talking to a group of theologians in 
London, Rahner said, 223The task of the theologi
an is to explain everything through God, 
and to explain God as unexplainable.224 Un
explainable mystery. One does not know, one 
cannot say. One says, 223Ah, ah...224  Words are pointers, they222re not descripti
ons. Tragically, people 
fall into idolatry 
because they think that where God is concer
ned, the word is the thing. How could you get 
so crazy? Can you be crazier than that? Even 
where human beings are concerned, or trees 
and leaves and animals, the word is not th
e thing. And you would say that, where God is 
concerned, the word is one thing? What are 
you talking about? An in
ternationally famous 
scripture scholar attended this course in Sa
n Francisco, and he said to me, 223My God, after 
listening to you, I understand that I222ve been an i
dol worshipper all my life!224 He said this 
openly. 223It never struck me that I had been an
 idol worshipper. My idol was not made of 
wood or metal; it was a mental idol.224 These 
are the more dangerous idol worshippers. 
They use a very subtle substance, the mind, to produce their God.  What I222m leading you to is the following: awareness of reality, around you. 
Awareness means to watch, to observe wh
at is going on within you and around you. 
223Going on224 is pretty accurate: Trees,
 grass, flowers, animals, rock, 
all
 of reality is 
moving. One observes it, one watches it. How esse
ntial it is for the human being not just 
to observe himself or herself, but to wa
tch all of reality. Are you imprisoned by your 
concepts? Do you want to break out of your prison? Then 
look; observe; spend hours 
observing. Watching what? 
Anything
. The faces of people, the shapes of trees, a bird in 
flight, a pile of stones, watc
h the grass grow. Get in touch with things, look at them. 
Hopefully you will then break out of these ri
gid patterns we have all developed, out of 
what our thoughts and our words have imposed on us. Hopefully we will see. What will 
we see? This thing that we choose to call re
ality, whatever is beyond words and concepts. 
This is a spiritual
 exercise227connected with spirituality227connected with breaking out of 
your cage, out of the imprisonment of the concepts and words.  How sad if we pass through life and never 
see it with the eyes
 of a child. This 
doesn222t mean you should drop your concepts 
totally; they222re very precious. Though we 
begin without them, concepts have a very pos
itive function. Thanks to them we develop 
our intelligence. We222re invited, not to become children, but to become 
like
 children. We 
do have to fall from a stage of innocence and 
be thrown out of paradise; we do have to 
develop an 223I224 and a 223me224 through 
these concepts. But then we ne
ed to return to paradise. 
We need to be redeemed again. We need to put off the old man, the old nature, the 
conditioned self, and return to th
e state of the child but without 
being
 a child. When we 
start off in life, we look at reality with w
onder, but it isn222t the in
telligent wonder of the 
mystics; it222s the formless wonder of the 
child. Then wonder dies and is replaced by 
boredom, as we develop language and words and concepts. Then hopefully, if we222re   58  lucky, we222ll return to wonder again.      AT A LOSS FOR WORDS    Dag Hammarskj366ld, the former
 UN Secretary-General, put 
it so beautifully: 223God 
does not die on the day we cease to believe in a personal deity. But we die on the day 
when our lives cease to be illumined by the 
steady radiance of wonder renewed daily, the 
source of which is beyond all reason.224 We 
don222t have to quarrel 
about a word, because 
223God224 is only a word, a concept. One never 
quarrels about reality;
 we only quarrel about 
opinions, about concepts, about judgments. 
Drop your concepts, dr
op your opinions, drop 
your prejudices, drop your judgments, and you will see that.  223Quia de deo scire non possumus quid 
sit, sed quid non sit, non possumus 
considerare de deo, quomodo sit sed quomodo non sit.224
 This is St. Thomas Aquinas222 
introduction to his whole Summa Theologica
: 223Since we cannot know what God is, but 
only what God is not, we cannot consider how God is but only how He is not.224 I have 
already mentioned Thomas222 commentary on Boethius222 De Sancta Trinitate
, where he 
says that the loftiest degree of the knowledge of God is to know God as the unknown, 
tamquam ignotum
. And in his Questio Disputata de Potentia Dei
, Thomas says, 223This is 
what is ultimate in the human knowledge of God227to know that we do not know God.224 
This gentleman was considered the prince of
 theologians. He was a mystic, and is a 
canonized saint today. We222re 
standing on pretty good ground.  In India, we have a Sanskrit saying for this kind of thing: 
223neti, neti.224
 It means: 223not 
that, not that.224 Thomas222 own 
method was referred to as the 
via negativa
, the negative 
way. C. S. Lewis wrote a diary wh
ile his wife was dying. It222s called 
A Grief Observed
. 
He had married an American woman whom he
 loved dearly. He told his friends, 223God 
gave me in my sixties what He denied me 
in my twenties.224 He hardly had married her 
when she died a painful death of cancer. Lewis 
said that his whole faith crumbled, like a 
house of cards. Here he was the great Christian apologist, but when di
saster struck home, 
he asked himself, 223Is God a loving Father or
 is God the great vivi
sectionist?224 There222s 
pretty good evidence for both! I remember th
at when my own mother got cancer, my 
sister said to me, 223Tony, why did God allow th
is to happen to Mother?224 I said to her, 
223My dear, last year a million people died of
 starvation in China because of the drought, 
and you never raised a question.224 Sometimes the best thing that can happ
en to us is to be 
awakened to reality, for calamity to strike, for 
then we come to faith, as C. S. Lewis did. 
He said that he never had 
any doubts before about people su
rviving death, but when his 
wife died, he was no longer certain. Why? Beca
use it was so important to him that she be 
living. Lewis, as you know, is the master of
 comparisons and analogies. He says, 223It222s 
like a rope. Someone says to you, 221Would this
 bear the weight of a hundred twenty 
pounds? You answer, 221Yes.222 221Well, we222re going to let down your best friend on this 
rope.222 Then you say, 221Wait a minute, let me te
st that rope again.222 
You222re not so sure 
now.224 Lewis also said in his diary that we cannot know anything about God and even our 
questions about God are absurd. Why? It222s 
as though a person born blind asks you, 223The 
color green, is it hot or cold?224 
Neti, neti
, not that. 223Is it long or is
 it short?224 Not that. 223Is it 
sweet or is it sour?224 Not that. 223Is it round or oval or square?224 Not th
at, not that. The blind 
person has no words, no concepts, for a color 
of which he has no idea, no intuition, no   59  experience. You can only speak to him in 
analogies. No matter what he asks, you can 
only say, 223Not that.224 C. S. Lewis says some
where that it222s like asking how many minutes 
are in the color yellow. Ever
ybody could be taking the question very seriously, discussing 
it, fighting about it. One person 
suggests there are tw
enty-five carrots in the color yellow, 
the other person says, 223No, seventeen potatoe
s,224 and they222re suddenl
y fighting. Not that, 
not that!  This is what is ultimate in our human 
knowledge of God, to know that we do not 
know. Our great tragedy is that we know too much. We 
think
 we know, that is our 
tragedy; so we never discover. In fact, T
homas Aquinas (he222s not 
only a theologian but 
also a great philosopher) says repeatedl
y, 223All the efforts of the human mind cannot 
exhaust the essence of a single fly.224      CULTURAL CONDITIONING    Something more about words. I said to you 
earlier that words are limited. There is 
more I have to add. There are some words that correspond to 
nothing. For instance, I222m 
an Indian. Now, let222s suppose that I222m a pris
oner of war in Pakistan, and they say to me, 
223Well, today we222re going to take you to the 
frontier, and you222re going to take a look at 
your country.224 So they bring me to the front
ier, and I look across the border, and I think, 
223Oh, my country, my beautiful country. I see vi
llages and trees and hills. This is my own, 
my native land!224 After a while one of th
e guards says, 223Excuse me, we222ve made a 
mistake here. We have to move up another te
n miles.224 What was I reacting to? Nothing. I 
kept focusing on a word, India. But trees are not
 India; trees are trees
. In fact, there are no 
frontiers or boundaries. They were put th
ere by the human mind; generally by stupid, 
avaricious politicians. My country was one 
country once upon a time; it222s four now. If we 
don222t watch out it might be six. 
Then we222ll have six flags, 
six armies. That222s why you222ll 
never catch me saluting a flag. I abhor all nati
onal flags because they are idols. What are 
we saluting? I salute humanity, not
 a flag with an army around it.  Flags are in the heads of people. In any 
case, there are thousa
nds of words in our 
vocabulary that do not correspond to
 reality at all. But do they trigger emotions in us! So 
we begin to see things that 
are not there. We actually see Indian mountains when they 
don222t exist, and we actually see Indian pe
ople who also don222t exist. Your American 
conditioning exists. My Indian conditioning 
exists. But that222s not a very happy thing. 
Nowadays, in Third World countries, we talk 
a great deal about 223inculturation.224 What is 
this thing called 223culture224? 
I222m not very happy with the word. Does it mean you222d like to 
do something because you were conditioned to do it? That you222d like to feel something 
because you were conditioned to feel it? 
Isn222t that being mechanical? Imagine an 
American baby that is adopted by a Russian co
uple and taken to Russia. It has no notion 
that it was born American. It222s brought up ta
lking Russian; it lives and dies for Mother 
Russia; it hates Americans. The child is stam
ped with his own culture; it222s steeped in its 
own literature. It looks at the world through the 
eyes of its culture. Now, if you want to 
wear your culture the way you wear your clothe
s, that222s fine. The Indian woman would 
wear a sari and the American woman would 
wear something else, the Japanese woman 
would wear her kimono. But nobody identifies he
rself with the clothes. But you do want 
to wear your culture more intently. You b
ecome proud of your culture. They teach you to   60  be proud of it. Let me put this as forcefully as
 possible. There222s this Jesuit friend of mine 
who said to me, 223Anytime I see a beggar or 
a poor person, I cannot 
not give this person 
alms. I got that from my mother.224 His moth
er would offer a meal to any poor person who 
passed by. I said to him, 223Joe, what you ha
ve is not a virtue; what you have is a 
compulsion, a 
good one from the point of view of the beggar, but a compulsion 
nonetheless.224 I remember another Jesuit who said
 to us once at an intimate gathering of 
the men of our Jesuit province in Bombay, 223I222m
 eighty years old; I222ve been a Jesuit for 
sixty-five years. I have never once missed my hour of meditation227never once.224 Now, 
that 
could
 be very admirable, or it could also be 
a compulsion. No great merit in it if it222s 
mechanical. The beauty of an action comes not
 from its having become a habit but from 
its sensitivity, consciousness, clarity of pe
rception, and accuracy of response. I can say 
yes to one beggar and no to another. I 
am not compelled by any conditioning or 
programming from my past experiences 
or from my culture. Nobody has stamped 
anything on me, or if they have, I222m no longer reacting on the basis 
of that. If you had a 
bad experience with an American or were bi
tten by a dog or had a 
bad experience with a 
certain type of food, for the rest of your lif
e you222d be influenced by that experience. And 
that222s bad! You need to be liberated from
 that. Don222t carry over experiences from the 
past. In fact, don222t carry over good experiences 
from the past either. Learn what it means 
to experience something fully, then dr
op it and move on to the next moment, 
uninfluenced by the previous one. You222d be tr
aveling with such li
ttle baggage that you 
could pass through the eye of a needle. You222d 
know what eternal lif
e is, because eternal 
life is 
now
, in the timeless 
now
. Only thus will you enter in
to eternal life. But how many 
things we carry along with us. We never se
t about the task of 
freeing ourselves, of 
dropping the baggage, of being ourselves. I222m 
sorry to say that everywhere I go I find 
Muslims who use their religion, their worship, 
and their Koran to di
stract themselves 
from this task. And the same applies to Hindus and Christians.  Can you imagine the human being who is 
no longer influenced by words? You can 
give him any number of words and he222ll st
ill give you a fair deal. You can say, 223I222m 
Cardinal Archbishop So-and-so,224 but he222ll still give you a fa
ir deal; he222ll see you as you 
are. He222s uninfluenced by the label.      FILTERED REALITY    I want to say one more thing about our pe
rception of reality. Let me put it in the 
form of an analogy. The President of the Un
ited States has to get feedback from the 
citizens. The Pope in Rome has to get feedback from the whole Church. There are 
literally millions of items that 
could be fed to them, but they 
could hardly take all of them 
in, much less digest them. So they have pe
ople whom they trust to make abstracts, 
summarize things, monitor, filter; in the end, so
me of it gets to their desk. Now, this is 
what222s happening to us. From every pore or 
living cell of our bodies and from all our 
senses we are getting feedback from reality. 
But we are filtering things out constantly. 
Who222s doing the filtering? Our conditioning? Our culture? Our programming? The way 
we were taught to see things
 and to experience them? Even our language can be a filter. 
There is so much filtering going on that some
times you won222t see things that are there. 
You only have to look at a paranoid pe
rson who222s always feeling threatened by   61  something that isn222t there, who222s constantly
 interpreting reality in terms of certain 
experiences of the past or certain conditioning that he or she has had.  But there222s another demon, too, who222s doing 
the filtering. It222s called attachment, 
desire, craving. The root of 
sorrow is craving. Craving dist
orts and destroys perception. 
Fears and desires haunt us. Samuel Johnson sa
id, 223The knowledge that he is to swing 
from a scaffold within a week wonderfully concentrates a man222s mind.224 You blot out 
everything else and concentrate only on the fear
, or desire, or crav
ing. In many ways we 
were drugged when we were young. We were 
brought up to need people. For what? For 
acceptance, approval, appreciation, applause227f
or what they called success. Those are 
words that do not correspond to reality. They 
are conventions, things
 that are invented, 
but we don222t realize that they don222t correspond to
 reality. What is success? It is what one 
group decided is a good thing. Another group will 
decide the same thing is bad. What is 
good in Washington might be considered ba
d in a Carthusian monastery. Success in a 
political circle might be considered failure 
in some other circles. These are conventions. 
But we treat them like realities, don222t 
we? When we were young, we were programmed 
to unhappiness. They taught us that in order to be happy you need money, success, a 
beautiful or handsome partne
r in life, a good job, friends
hip, spirituality, God227you name 
it. Unless you get these things, you222re not going 
to be happy, we were told. Now, that is 
what I call an attachment. An 
attachment is a belief that
 without something you are not 
going to be happy. Once you get convinced of th
at227and it gets into our subconscious, it 
gets stamped into the roots 
of our being227you are finished. 223How could I be happy unless 
I have good health?224 you say. Bu
t I222ll tell you something. I have met people dying of 
cancer who were happy. But how could they be happy if they knew they were going to 
die? But they were. 223How could I be ha
ppy if I don222t have money?224 One person has a 
million dollars in the bank, and he feels ins
ecure; the other person has practically no 
money, but he doesn222t seem to feel any insecu
rity at all. He was programmed differently, 
that222s all. Useless to exhort the first pers
on about what to do; he
 needs understanding. 
Exhortations are of no great help. You need 
to understand that you222
ve been programmed; 
it222s a false belief. See it as false, see it as
 a fantasy. What are pe
ople doing all through 
their lives? They222re busy 
fighting; fight, fight, fight. That222s
 what they call survival. When 
the average American says he or she is making a living, it isn222t a living they222re making, 
oh no! They have much more than they need 
to live. Come to my 
country and you222ll see 
that. You don222t need all those 
cars to live. You don222t need 
a television set to live. You 
don222t need makeup to live. You don222t need all 
those clothes to live. But try to convince 
the average American of this. They222ve been
 brainwashed; they222ve been programmed. So 
they work and strive to get the desired objec
t that will make them happy. Listen to this 
pathetic story227your story, my 
story, everybody222s story: 223Until
 I get this object (money, 
friendship, anything) I222m not going 
to be happy; I222ve got to strive to get it and then when 
I222ve got it, I222ve got to strive 
to keep it. I get a temporary th
rill. Oh, I222m so thrilled, I222ve 
got it!224 But how long does that last? A few 
minutes, a few days at the most. When you 
get your brand-new car, how long doe
s the thrill last
? Until your 
next attachment is 
threatened!  The truth about a thrill is that I get tired of it after a while. They told me 
prayer was 
the big thing; they told me 
God
 was the big thing; they told me 
friendship
 was the big 
thing. And not knowing what prayer really wa
s or not knowing what God really was, not 
knowing what friendship really wa
s, we made much out of th
em. But after a while we got   62  bored with them227bored with prayer, with G
od, with friendship. Isn222
t that pathetic? And 
there222s no way out, there222s simply no way out. 
It222s the only model we were given227to be 
happy. We weren222t given any other model. Our 
culture, our society, a
nd, I222m sorry to say, 
even our religion gave us no other model. 
You222ve been appointed a cardinal. What a 
great honor that is! Honor? Did you say honor
? You used the wrong word. Now others 
are going to aspire to it. You 
lapsed into what the gospels call 223the world224 and you222re 
going to lose your soul. The world, power, prestige, winning, succe
ss, honor, etc., are 
nonexistent things. You gain the world but you 
lose your soul. Your whole life has been 
empty and soulless. There is nothing there. 
There222s only one way out 
and that is to get 
deprogrammed! How do you do that? You b
ecome aware of the programming. You 
cannot change by an effort of the will; 
you cannot change through ideals; you cannot 
change through building up new habits. Your
 behavior may change, but you don222t. You 
only change through awareness and understandin
g. When you see a stone as a stone and a 
scrap of paper as a scrap of paper, you don222t think that the stone 
is a precious diamond 
anymore and you don222t think that that scrap of
 paper is a check for a billion dollars. 
When you 
see that, you change. There222s no violence 
anymore in your attempt to change 
yourself. Otherwise, what you call change is
 simply moving the furniture around. Your 
behavior is changed, but not 
you
.      DETACHMENT    The only way to change is by changing 
your understanding. But what does it mean 
to understand? How do we go about it? C
onsider how we222re enslaved by various 
attachments; we222re striving to rearrange the wo
rld so that we can keep these attachments, 
because the world is a constant threat to them. I fear that
 a friend may stop loving me; he 
or she may turn to somebody else. I have to keep making myself attractive because I have 
to get this other person. Somebody brainwashed 
me into thinking I need his or her love. 
But I really don222t. I don222t need
 anybody222s love; I just need to
 get in touch with reality. I 
need to break out of this prison of mine, 
this programming, this conditioning, these false 
beliefs, these fantasies; I need to
 break out into reality. Reality 
is lovely; it is an absolute 
delight. Eternal life is now. We222re surrounded 
by it, like the fish in the ocean, but we 
have no notion about it at all. We222re too dist
racted with this attachment. Temporarily, the 
world rearranges itself to suit 
our attachment, so we say, 223Y
eah, great! My team won!224 
But hang on; it222ll change; you222ll be depre
ssed tomorrow. Why do we keep doing this?  Do this little exercise for a few minutes
: Think of something or someone you are 
attached to; in other words,
 something or someone without which or without whom you 
think you are not going to be happy. It could 
be your job, your career, your profession, 
your friend, your money, whatever
. And say to this object or 
person, 223I really do not need 
you to be happy. I222m only deluding myself in 
the belief that wit
hout you I will not be 
happy. But I really don222t need you for my 
happiness; I can be happy without you. You 
are not my happiness, you are not my joy.224 If 
your attachment is a person, he or she is not 
going to be very happy to hear you say this, 
but go ahead anyway. You can say it in the 
secrecy of your heart. In any case, you222ll, 
be making contact with the truth; you222ll be 
smashing through a fantasy. Happiness is a 
state of nonillusion, of dropping the illusion.  Or you could try another exercise: Think of
 a time when you were heartbroken and   63  thought you would never be happy again (your 
husband died, your wi
fe died, your best 
friend deserted you, you lost your money). Wh
at happened? Time 
went on, and if you 
managed to pick up another attachment 
or managed to find somebody else you were 
attracted to or something else you were 
attracted to, what 
happened to the old 
attachment? You didn222t really need it to be
 happy, did you? That should have taught you, 
but we never learn. We222re programmed; we222re
 conditioned. How liber
ating it is not to 
depend emotionally on anything. If you could ge
t one second222s experience of that, you222d 
be breaking through your pris
on and getting a glimpse of the sky. Someday, maybe, you 
will even fly.  I was afraid to say this, bu
t I talked to God, and I told
 Him that I don222t need Him. 
My initial reaction was: 223Thi
s is so contrary to everyt
hing that I222ve been brought up 
with.224 Now, some people want to make an exception of their attachment to God. They 
say, 223If God is the God that I think He ought to 
be, He222s not going to like it when I give 
up my attachment to Him!224 All right, if 
you think that unless you get God you222re not 
going to be happy, then this 223God224 you222re th
inking of has nothing to
 do with the real 
God. You222re thinking of a dream state; you222re
 thinking of your concept. Sometimes you 
have to get rid of 223God224 in order to 
find God. Lots of mystics tell us that.  We222ve been so blinded by everything that
 we have not discovered the basic truth 
that attachments hurt rather than help relati
onships. I remember how frightened I was to 
say to an intimate friend of mine, 223I really don222t need you. I can be perfectly happy 
without you. And by telling you this I fi
nd I can enjoy your company thoroughly227no 
more anxieties, no more jealousies, no mo
re possessiveness, no more clinging. It is a 
delight to be with you when I am enjoying you on a nonclinging basis. You222re free; so am 
I.224 But to many of you I222m sure this is like 
talking a foreign language. It took me many, 
many months to fully understand this, a
nd mind you, I222m a Jesuit, whose spiritual 
exercises are all about exactly this, although 
I missed the point because my culture and 
my society in general had taught me to view pe
ople in terms of my attachments. I222m quite 
amused, sometimes, to see even seemingly objective people like therapists and spiritual 
directors say of someone, 223He222s a great guy, great guy, I really like him.224 I find out later 
that it222s because he likes me 
that I like him. I look into myself, and I find the same thing 
coming up now and again: If you222re attached 
to appreciation and pr
aise, you222re going to 
view people in terms of thei
r threat to your attachment 
or their fostering of your 
attachment. If you222re a politician and you wa
nt to be elected, 
how do you think you222re 
going to look at people, how will your inte
rest in people be guided? You will be 
concerned for the person who222s going to get you 
the vote. If what you222re interested in is 
sex, how do you think you222re going to look at 
men and women? If you222re attached to 
power, that colors your view of
 human beings. An attachment
 destroys your capacity to 
love. What is love? Love is sensitivity, love
 is consciousness. To give you an example: 
I222m listening to a symphony, but if all I hear
 is the sound of the drums I don222t hear the 
symphony. What is a loving heart? A 
loving heart is sensitive to the 
whole
 of life, to 
all
 
persons; a loving heart doesn222t harden itself 
to any person or thing. But the moment you 
become attached in my sense of the word, 
then you222re blocking out many other things. 
You222ve got eyes only for the object of your
 attachment; you222ve got ears only for the 
drums; the heart has hardened. Moreover, it222s blinded, because it no longer sees the 
object of its attachment object
ively. Love entails clarity of
 perception, objectivity; there 
is nothing so clear-sighted as love.   64      ADDICTIVE LOVE    The heart in love remains soft and se
nsitive. But when you222re hell-bent on 
getting
 
this or the other thing, you become ruthle
ss, hard, and insensitive. How can you love 
people when you need people? You can only use them. If I need you to make me happy, 
I222ve got to use you, I222ve got to manipulate you, I222ve got to find ways and means of 
winning you. I cannot let you be free. I can only 
love people when I have emptied my life 
of people. When I die to the need for people, 
then I222m right in the desert. In the beginning 
it feels awful, it feels lonely, but if you can 
take it for a while, you222
ll suddenly discover 
that it isn222t lonely at all. It
 is solitude, it is aloneness, and the desert begins to flower. 
Then at last you222ll know what l
ove is, what God is, what rea
lity is. But in the beginning 
giving up the drug can be tough, unless you have
 a very keen understanding or unless you 
have suffered enough. It222s a great thing to have 
suffered. Only then can you get sick of it. 
You can make use of suffering to end su
ffering. Most people simply go on suffering. 
That explains the conflict I sometimes have be
tween the role of spiritu
al director and that 
of therapist. A therapist says, 
223Let222s ease the suffering.224 The spiritual director says, 223Let 
her suffer, she222ll get sick of this way of re
lating to people and she222
ll finally decide to 
break out of this prison of emotional dependen
ce on others.224 Shall I o
ffer a palliative or 
remove a cancer? It222s not easy to decide.  A person slams a book on the table in disgust. Let him keep slamming it on the 
table. Don222t pick up the book for him and tell him 
it222s all right. Spiritua
lity is awareness, 
awareness, awareness, awareness, awareness, awareness. When your mother got angry 
with you, she didn222t say ther
e was something wrong with her, she said there was 
something wrong with you
; otherwise she wouldn222t have 
been angry. Well, I made the 
great discovery that if 
you
 are angry, Mother, ther
e222s something wrong with you
. So 
you222d better cope with 
your anger. Stay with it and cope 
with it. It222s not mine. Whether 
there222s something wrong with me or not, I222ll 
examine that independently of your anger. 
I222m not going to be influenced by your anger.  The funny thing is that when I can do this
 without feeling a
ny negativity toward 
another, I can be quite objective about myse
lf, too. Only a very aware person can refuse 
to pick up the guilt and anger, can say, 223Y
ou222re having a tantrum. Too bad. I don222t feel 
the slightest desire to rescue
 you anymore, and I refuse to 
feel guilty.224 I222m not going to 
hate myself for anything I222ve done. That222s what guilt is. I222m not going to give myself a 
bad feeling and whip myself for anything I have done, either 
right
 or 
wrong
. I222m ready to 
analyze it, to watch it, and say, 223Well, 
if I did wrong, it was in unawareness.224 Nobody 
does wrong in awareness
. That222s why theologians tell us 
very beautifully 
that Jesus could 
do no wrong. That makes very good sense to me, because the enlightened person can do 
no wrong. The enlightened person is free. Jesu
s was free and because he was free, he 
couldn222t do any wrong. But since you 
can
 do wrong, you222re not free.         65  MORE WORDS    Mark Twain put it very nicely when he said, 223It was so cold that if the thermometer 
had been an inch longer, we would have frozen to death.224 We do freeze to death on 
words. It222s not the cold outside that matters, but the thermometer. It222s not reality that 
matters, but what you222re saying to yourself a
bout it. I was told a 
lovely story about a 
farmer in Finland. When they were drawi
ng up the Russian-Finnish border, the farmer 
had to decide whether he wanted to be in 
Russia or Finland. After 
a long time he said he 
wanted to be in Finland, but he
 didn222t want to offend the Russian officials. These came to 
him and wanted to know why he wanted to 
be in Finland. The farmer replied, 223It has 
always been my desire to live in Mother Ru
ssia, but at my age I wouldn222t be able to 
survive another Russian winter.224  Russia and Finland are only words, concep
ts, but not for human beings, not for 
crazy human beings. We222re almost never l
ooking at reality. A gur
u was once attempting 
to explain to a crowd how human beings reac
t to words, feed on words, live on words, 
rather than on reality. One of the men stood up 
and protested; he sai
d, 223I don222t agree that 
words have all that much effect on us.224 Th
e guru said, 223Sit down, you son of a bitch.224 
The man went livid with rage and said, 223Y
ou call yourself an enlightened person, a guru, 
a master, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.224 The guru then said, 223Pardon me, sir, I 
was carried away. I really beg 
your pardon; that was a lapse;
 I222m sorry.224 The man finally 
calmed down. Then the guru said, 223It took just a few words to get a whole tempest going 
within you; and it took just a few words to
 calm you down, didn222t 
it?224 Words, words, 
words, words, how imprisoning they 
are if they222re not used properly.       HIDDEN AGENDAS    There is a difference between knowledge a
nd awareness, between information and 
awareness. I just said to you that one cannot
 do evil in awareness. But one can do evil in 
knowledge or information, when you know
 something is bad. 223Father, forgive them, for 
they know not what they do.224 I woul
d translate that as 223They222re not 
aware
 of what they 
are doing.224 Paul says he is th
e greatest of sinners because he persecuted the Church of 
Christ. But, he adds, I did it 
unawares. Or if they had been
 aware
 that they were 
crucifying the Lord of Glory, they would never have done so. Or: 223The time will come 
when they will persecute you and they think
 they are doing a service to God.224 They aren222t 
aware. They222re caught up in information a
nd knowledge. Thomas A
quinas puts it nicely 
when he says, 223Every time someone sins
, they222re sinning unde
r the guise of good.224 
They222re blinding themselves; they222re seeing something as good even though they know it 
is bad; they222re rationalizing 
because they222re seeking something under the pretext of good.  Someone gave me two situations in which 
she found it difficult to be aware. She was 
in a service industry where many people we
re lined up, many phones were ringing, and 
she was alone and there were distractions co
ming from a lot of uptight, angry people. She 
found it extremely difficult to maintain seren
ity and calm. The othe
r situation was when 
she was driving in traffic, with horns blowing and people shouting four-letter words. She 
asked me whether eventually that nervousne
ss would dissipate and she could remain at   66  peace.  Did you pick up the attachment there? Peace.
 Her attachment to peace and calm. She 
was saying, 223Unless I222m peaceful, I won222t be 
happy.224 Did it ever occur to you that you 
could be happy 
in tension
? Before enlightenment, I used
 to be depressed; after 
enlightenment, I continue to be depressed. 
You don222t make a goal out of relaxation and 
sensitivity. Have you ever heard of people who ge
t tense trying to relax? If one is tense, 
one simply observes one222s tension. You w
ill never understand yourself if you seek to 
change yourself. The harder you try to change yourself, the worse it gets. You are called 
upon to be aware. Get the feel 
of that jangling telephone; get the feel of
 jarred nerves; get 
the sensation of the stee
ring wheel in the car. In other words, come to 
reality, and let 
tension or the calmness take care of itself. As a matter of fact, you will have to let them 
take care of themselves because you222ll be 
too preoccupied with getting in touch with 
reality. Step by step, let whatever happens happen. Real change will come when it is 
brought about, not by your ego, but by reality. Awareness releases reality to change you.  In awareness you change, but you222ve got to experience it. At this 
point you222re just 
taking my word for it. Perhaps also you222ve got a plan to become aw
are. Your ego, in its 
own cunning way, is trying to push you into aw
areness. Watch it! You222ll meet with 
resistance; there will be trouble. When so
meone is anxious about being aware all the 
time, you can spot the mild anxiety. They want 
to be awake, to find out if they222re really 
awake or not. That222s part of 
asceticism
, not awareness. It sounds strange in a culture 
where we222ve been trained to achieve goals, to 
get somewhere, but in fact there222s nowhere 
to go because you222re there already. The Japanese have a nice way of putting it: 223The day 
you cease to travel, you will have ar
rived.224 Your attitude should 
be: 223I want to be aware, 
I want to be in touch with 
whatever is and let whatever 
happens happen; if I222m awake, 
fine, and if I222m asleep, fine.224 The moment
 you make a goal out of it and attempt to 
get
 it, 
you222re seeking ego glorification, ego promo
tion. You want the good feeling that you222ve 
made it. When you do 223make it,224 you won222t know. Your left hand won222t know what your 
right hand is doing. 223Lord, when did we do this
? We had no awareness.224 Charity is never 
so lovely as when one has lost consciousne
ss that one is practicing charity. 223You mean I 
helped you? I was enjoying myself. I was just
 doing my dance. It helped you, that222s 
wonderful. Congratulations 
to you. No credit to me.224  When you attain, when you are aware, increasingly you will not be bothered about 
labels like 223awake224 or 223asleep.224 One of my diff
iculties here is to arouse your curiosity but 
not your spiritual greed. Let222s come awake, it222s
 going to be wonderful. After a while, it 
doesn222t matter; one is aware, because one liv
es. The unaware life is not worth living. And 
you will leave pain to take care of itself.      GIVING IN    The harder you try to change, the worse it 
can get. Does this mean that a certain 
degree of passivity is all right
? Yes, the more you resist something, the greater power you 
give to it. That222s the mean
ing, I think, of Jesus222 words:
 223When someone strikes you on 
the right cheek, offer him your left as well.
224 You always empower the demons you fight. 
That222s very Oriental. But if you flow with the enemy, you overcome the enemy. How 
does one cope with evil? Not by fighting it but by understanding it.
 In understanding, it   67  disappears. How does one cope with darkne
ss? Not with one222s fist. You don222t chase 
darkness out of the room with a broom, you tu
rn on a light. The more you fight darkness, 
the more real it becomes to you, and the more you exhaust yourself. But when you turn 
on the light of awareness, it melts. Say this sc
rap of paper is a bil
lion-dollar check. Ah, I 
must renounce it, the gospel says, 
I must give it up if I want eternal life. Are you going to 
substitute one greed227a spiritual greed227for
 the other greed? Before, you had a worldly 
ego and now you222ve got a spiritual ego, but you222
ve got an ego all the same, a refined one 
and one more difficult to cope with. When 
you renounce something, you222re tied to it. But 
if instead of renouncing it, I l
ook at it and say, 223Hey, this isn222
t a billion-dollar check, this 
is a scrap of paper,224 there is not
hing to fight, nothing to renounce.      ASSORTED LANDMINES    In my country, lots of men grow up with th
e belief that women are cattle. 223I married 
her,224 they say. 223She222s my possession.224 Are th
ese men to blame? Get ready for a shock: 
They aren222t. Just as many Americans are not to blame for the way they view Russians. 
Their glasses or perceptions simply have been
 dyed a certain color, and there they are; 
that222s the color through which 
they look at the world. What 
does it take to make them 
real, to make them aware that they222re looki
ng at the world through colored glasses? There 
is no salvation till they have
 seen their basic prejudice.  As soon as you look at the world through an
 ideology you are finished. No reality 
fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. That 
is why people are always searching for a 
meaning to life. But life has no meaning; it
 cannot have meaning because meaning is a 
formula; meaning is something that makes 
sense to the mind. Every time you make sense 
out of reality, you bump into something that
 destroys the sense you made. Meaning is 
only found when you go beyond meaning. Life onl
y makes sense when you perceive it as 
mystery and it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.  I don222t say that adoration isn222t 
important, but I do say that doubt is infinitely more 
important than adoration. Everywhere people 
are searching for objec
ts to adore, but I 
don222t find people awake enough in their attit
udes and convictions. How happy we would 
be if terrorists would adore their ideology 
less and question more. However, we don222t like 
to apply that to ourselves; we think we222re 
all right and the terrorists are wrong. But a 
terrorist to you is a martyr to the other side.  Loneliness is when you222re missing peopl
e, aloneness is when you222re enjoying 
yourself. Remember that quip of George Bern
ard Shaw. He was at one of those awful 
cocktail parties, where nothing gets said. So
meone asked him if he was enjoying himself. 
He answered, 223It222s the only thing I am enj
oying here.224 You never 
enjoy others when you 
are enslaved to them. Community is not formed by a set of slaves, by people demanding 
that other people make them happy. Community 
is formed by emperors and princesses. 
You222re an emperor, not a beggar; you222re 
a princess, not a beggar. There222s no begging 
bowl in a true community. There222s no c
linging, no anxiety, no fear, no hangover, no 
possessiveness, no demands. Free people form 
community, not slaves. This is such a 
simple truth, but it has been drowned out by 
a whole culture, includi
ng religious culture. 
Religious culture can be very 
manipulative if you don222t watch out.  Some people see awareness as a high point, a plateau, 
beyond experiencing every   68  moment as it is. That222s making 
a goal out of awareness. But with true awareness there222s 
nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. How do 
we get to this awareness? Through 
awareness. When people say they really want
 to experience every moment, they222re really 
talking awareness, except for that 223wanti
ng.224 You don222t want to experience awareness; 
you do or you don222t.  A friend of mine has just gone to Ireland. He
 told me that though he222s an American 
citizen he222s entitled to an Irish passport and wa
s getting one because he is scared to travel 
abroad on an American passport. If terrori
sts walk in and say, 223Let me see your 
passport,224 he wants to be able to say, 223I222m Irish.224 But when people sit next to him on the 
plane, they don222t want to see labels
; they want to taste and experience 
this
 person, as he 
really is. How many people 
spend their lives not eating food but eating the menu? A 
menu is only an indication of something that222s
 available. You want to eat the steak, not 
the words.      THE DEATH OF ME    Can one be fully human without experiencing tragedy? The only tragedy there is in 
the world is ignorance; all evil comes from that. The only trage
dy there is in the world is 
unwakefulness and unawareness. From them co
mes fear, and from fear comes everything 
else, but death is not a tragedy at all. Dying is wonderful; 
it222s only horrible to people who 
have never understood life. It222s only when you
222re afraid of life that
 you fear death. It222s 
only dead people who fear death. But people wh
o are alive have no fear of death. One of 
your American authors put it so well. He said 
awakening is the death 
of your belief in 
injustice and tragedy. The end of
 the world for a caterpillar is
 a butterfly for the master. 
Death is resurrection. We222re talking not a
bout some resurrection that will happen but 
about one that is happening right now. If you 
would die to the past
, if you would die to 
every minute, you would be the person who is fully alive, because a fu
lly alive person is 
one who is full of death. We222re always 
dying to things. We222re always shedding 
everything in order to be fully alive and to 
be resurrected at every moment. The mystics, 
saints, and others make great efforts to 
wake people up. If they don222t wake up, they222re 
always going to have these other minor ills 
like hunger, wars, and violence. The greatest 
evil is sleeping people, ignorant people.  A Jesuit once wrote a note to 
Father Arrupe, his superior
 general, asking him about 
the relative value of communi
sm, socialism, and capitalism. Father Arrupe gave him a 
lovely reply. He said, 223A system is about 
as good or as bad as 
the people who use it.224 
People with golden hearts would make capit
alism or communism or socialism work 
beautifully.  Don222t ask the world to change227you change first. Then you222ll get a good enough 
look at the world so that you222ll be able to change whatever you think ought to be 
changed. Take the obstruction ou
t of your own eye. If you don222t, you have lost the right 
to change anyone or anything. Till you ar
e aware of yourself, you have no right to 
interfere with anyone else or with the worl
d. Now, the danger of attempting to change 
others or change things when you yourself 
are not aware is that you may be changing 
things for your own convenience, your pride,
 your dogmatic convictions and beliefs, or 
just to relieve your negative feelings. I have
 negative feelings, so 
you better change in   69  such a way that I222ll feel good. First, cope with
 your negative feelings so that when you 
move out to change others, you222re not coming from hate or negativity
 but from love. It 
may seem strange, too, that people can be very
 hard on others and still be very loving. 
The surgeon can be hard on a patient and ye
t loving. Love can be very hard indeed.      INSIGHT AND  UNDERSTANDING    But what does self-change entail? I222ve said
 it in so many words, over and over, but 
now I222m going to break it down into little 
segments. First, insight. Not effort, not 
cultivating habits, not having an ideal. Ideals
 do a lot of damage. The whole time you222re 
focusing on what should be instead of focusi
ng on what is. And so you222re imposing what 
should be on a present reality, never having 
understood what present reality is. Let me 
give you an example of insight from my own 
experience in counseling. A priest comes to 
me and says he222s lazy; he wants to be more 
industrious, more active, but he is lazy. I ask 
him what 223lazy224 means. In the old days I woul
d have said to him, 223Let222s see, why don222t 
you make a list of things you want to do every day, and then 
every night you check them 
off, and it will give you a good feeling; build up 
habit that way.224 Or I might say to him, 
223Who is your ideal, your patron saint?224 And if he says St. Francis Xavier, I would tell 
him, 223See how much Xavier worked. You mu
st meditate on him and that will get you 
moving.224 That222s one way of going about it, but,
 I222m sorry to say, it222s superficial. Making 
him use his willpower, effort, doesn222t last 
very long. His behavior may change, but he 
does not. So I now move in the other directi
on. I say to him, 223Lazy, what222s that? There 
are a million types of laziness. Let222s hear what your type of laziness is. Describe what 
you
 mean by lazy?224 He says, 223Well, I ne
ver get anything done. I don222t feel like doing 
anything.224 I ask, 223You mean righ
t from the moment you get up in the morning?224 223Yes,224 
he answers. 223I wake up in the morning a
nd there222s nothing worth getting up for.224 223You222re 
depressed, then?224 I ask. 223You could call it that,224
 he says. 223I have 
sort of withdrawn.224 
223Have you always been like this?224 I ask. 223W
ell, not always. When I was younger, I was 
more active. When I was in the seminary, I 
was full of life.224 223So when did this begin?224 
223Oh, about three or four years ago.224 I ask hi
m if anything happened then. He thinks a 
while. I say, 223If you have to think so muc
h, nothing very special could have happened 
four years ago. How about the year before th
at?224 He says, 223Well, I was ordained that 
year.224 223Anything happen in your ordination ye
ar?224 I ask. 223There was 
one little thing, the 
final examination in theology; I failed it. It
 was a bit of a disappointment, but I222ve gotten 
over it. The bishop was planning to send me to Rome, to 
eventually teach in the 
seminary. I rather liked the idea, but since 
I failed the examination, he changed his mind 
and sent me to this parish. Actually, there 
was some injustice because . . .224 Now he222s 
getting worked up; there222s anger there that he hasn222t gotten over. He222s got to work 
through that disappointment. It222s
 useless to preach him a serm
on. It222s useless to give him 
an idea. We222ve got to get him to face his anger and disappointment and to get some 
insight into all of that. When he222s able to wo
rk through that, he222s back into life again. If I 
gave him an exhortation and told him how ha
rd his married brothers and sisters work, 
that would merely make him feel guilty. He do
esn222t have the self-insight which is going   70  to heal him. So that222s the first thing.  There222s another great task, understanding. 
Did you really think this was going to 
make you happy? You just assumed it was going to make you happy. Why did you want 
to teach in the seminary? Because you wanted to be happy. You thought that being a 
professor, having a certain status and 
prestige, would make you happy. Would it? 
Understanding is called for there.  In making the distinction between 223I224 and 223m
e,224 it222s a great help to disidentify what 
is going on. Let me give you an example of
 this kind of thing. A young Jesuit priest 
comes to see me; he222s a lovely, extraordin
ary, gifted, talented, charming, lovable man227
everything. But he had a strange kind of a ki
nk. With employees he was a terror. He was 
even known to assault them. It nearly becam
e a matter for the police. Whenever he was 
put in charge of the grounds, the school, or whatever, this problem would keep coming 
up. He made a thirty-day retreat in what we 
Jesuits call a Tertianship, where he meditated 
day after day on the patience and love of Je
sus for those who were underprivileged, etc. 
But I knew it wasn222t going to have an eff
ect. Anyway, he went home and was better for 
about three or four months. (Somebody said abou
t most retreats that we begin them in the 
name of the Father and of the Son and of th
e Holy Spirit, and we end as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world w
ithout end. Amen.) After that, he was right 
back to square one. So he came to see me. I was very busy at the time. Though he had 
come from another city in I
ndia, I couldn222t see him. So I said, 223I222m going for my evening 
walk; if you want to come with me on the 
walk, that222s fine, but I don222t have any other 
time.224 So we went for a walk. I222d known hi
m before, and as we were walking, I had a 
strange feeling. When I get one of these strange
 feelings, I generally check it out with the 
person in question. So I said, 223I have a strang
e feeling that you222re hiding something from 
me. Are you?224 He became indignant. He sa
id, 223What do you mean, hiding? Do you think 
I222d undertake this long journey and come to
 ask for your tune in order to hide 
something?224 I said, 223Well, it222s a funny feeling I had, that222s all; I thought I should check 
with you.224 We walked on. We have a lake no
t far from where I live. I remember the 
scene distinctly. He said, 223Could we sit 
down somewhere?224 I said, 223O.K.224 We sat on a 
low wall that skirts the lake. He said, 223You
222re right. I am hiding something from you.224 
And with that he burst into tears. He sai
d, 223I222m going to tell you something I222ve never 
said to anybody since I became a Jesuit. My father died when I was very young, and my 
mother became a servant. Her job was to clean
 lavatories and toilets and bathrooms, and 
sometimes she222d work for sixteen hours a day to get the wherewith
al to support us. I222m 
so ashamed of that that I222ve hidden it 
from everybody and I continue taking revenge, 
irrationally, on her and the whole servant cl
ass.224 The feeling got transferred. No one 
could make sense of why this charming man 
was doing this, but the moment he saw that, 
there was never any trouble ag
ain, never. He was all right.      NOT PUSHING IT    Meditating on and imitating externally the be
havior of Jesus is no help. It222s not a 
question of imitating Christ, it222s a question of
 becoming what Jesus was. It222s a question 
of becoming Christ, becoming aware, understa
nding what222s going on within you. All the 
other methods we use for self-change could be
 compared to pushing a car. Let222s suppose   71  you have to travel to a distant city. The car
 breaks down along the way. Well, too bad; the 
car222s broken down. So we roll up our sleeves 
and begin to push the car. And we push and 
push and push and push, till we get to the dist
ant city. 223Well,224 we say, 223we made it.224 And 
then we push the car all the way to another city! 
You say, 223We got there, didn222t we?224 But 
do you call this life? You know what you n
eed? You need an expert, you need a 
mechanic to lift the hood and change the sp
ark plug. Turn the ignition key and the car 
moves. You need the expert227you need 
understanding, insight, awareness227you don222t 
need pushing. You don222t need effort. That222s 
why people are so tired, so weary. You and I 
were trained to be dissatisfied with ou
rselves. That222s where the evil comes from 
psychologically. We222re always dissatisfied, 
we222re always discont
ented, we222re always 
pushing. Go on, put out more effort, more a
nd more effort. But there222s always that 
conflict inside; there222s ve
ry little understanding.      GETTING REAL    One red-letter day in my life occurred in 
India. It was a great day, really, the day 
after I was ordained. I sat in 
a confessional. We had a very saintly Jesuit priest in our 
parish, a Spaniard, whom I had known even befo
re I went to the Jesu
it novitiate. The day 
before I left for the novitiate,
 I thought I222d better make a 
clean breast of everything so 
that when I got to the noviti
ate I222d be nice and clean and w
ouldn222t have to tell the novice 
master anything. This old Spanish priest w
ould have crowds of people lined up at his 
confessional; he had a violet
-colored handkerchief which he
 covered his eyes with, and 
he222d mumble something and give you a penance and send you away. He222d only met me a 
couple of times, but he222d call me Antonie. So
 I stood in line, and when my turn came, I 
tried changing my voice as I made my confessi
on. He listened to me patiently, gave me 
my penance, absolved me, and then said, 
223Antonie, when are you going to the novitiate?224  Well, anyway, I went to this parish the 
day after my ordination. And the old priest 
says to me, 223Do you want to hear confessions?224 
I said, 223All right.224 He said, 223Go and sit in 
my confessional.224 I thought, 223My, I222m a holy ma
n. I222m going to sit in his confessional.224 I 
heard confessions for three hours. It was 
Palm Sunday and we had the Easter crowd 
coming in. I came out depressed, not from what
 I had heard, because I had been led to 
expect that, and, having some inkling of 
what was going on in my own heart, I was 
shocked by nothing. You know what depressed 
me? The realization 
that I was giving 
them these little pious platitudes: 223Now pray
 to the Blessed Mother, she loves you,224 and 
223Remember that God is on your side.224 Were 
these pious platitudes any cure for cancer? 
And this is a cancer I222m dealing with, the la
ck of awareness and reality. So I swore a 
mighty oath to myself that day: 
223I222ll learn, I222ll learn, so it will 
not be said of me when it is 
all over, 221Father, what you said to me was absolutely true but totally useless.222224  Awareness, insight. When you become an e
xpert (and you222ll soon become an expert) 
you don222t need to take a course in psychol
ogy. As you begin to observe yourself, to 
watch yourself, to pick up those negative feelings, you222ll find your own way of 
explaining it. And you222ll notice the change. But 
then you222ll have to deal with the big 
villain, and that villain 
is self-condemnation, self-hatred, self-dissatisfaction.       72  ASSORTED IMAGES    Let222s talk more about effortlessness in ch
ange. I thought of a nice image for that, a 
sailboat. When a sailboat has a mighty wind in it
s sail, it glides along so effortlessly that 
the boatman has nothing to do but steer. He 
makes no effort; he doesn222t push the boat. 
That222s an image of what happens when ch
ange comes about through awareness, through 
understanding.  I was going through some of my notes and I 
found some quotations that go well with 
what I222ve been saying. Listen to this one: 223The
re is nothing so crue
l as nature. In the 
whole universe there is no escape from it, and 
yet it is not nature that does the injury, but 
the person222s own heart.224 Does that make sense?
 It isn222t nature that does the injury, but the 
person222s own heart. There222s the story of Paddy, who fell off the scaffolding and got a 
good bump. They asked, 223Did the fall hur
t you, Paddy?224 And he said, 223No, it was the 
stop that hurt, not the fall.224 When you cut wa
ter, the water doesn222t get hurt; when you cut 
something solid, it breaks. You222ve got so
lid attitudes inside you; you222ve got solid 
illusions inside you; that222s what bumps agains
t nature, that222s where you get hurt, that222s 
where the pain comes from.  Here222s a lovely one: It222s from an Orie
ntal sage, though I don222t remember which one. 
As with the Bible the author doe
sn222t matter. What is said is what matters. 223If the eye is 
unobstructed, it results in sight; if 
the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing; if the nose 
is unobstructed, the result is a sense of smell; 
if the mouth is unobstructed, the result is a 
sense of taste; if the mind is 
unobstructed, the result is wisdom.224  Wisdom occurs when you drop barriers you have erected through 
your concepts and 
conditioning. Wisdom is not something acquire
d; wisdom is not experience; wisdom is 
not applying yesterday222s illusions to today222
s problems. As somebody said to me while I 
was studying for my degree in psychology in 
Chicago years ago, 223Frequently, in the life 
of a priest, fifty years222 experience is one y
ear222s experience repeated fifty times.224 You get 
the same solutions to fall back on: This is th
e way to deal with the 
alcoholic; this is the 
way to deal with priests; this is the way to de
al with sisters; this227is the way to deal with 
a divorcee. But that isn222t wisdom. 
Wisdom is to be sensitive to this
 situation, to 
this
 
person, uninfluenced by any carryover from the 
past, without residue from the experience 
of the past. This is quite un
like what most people are accustomed to thinking. I would add 
another sentence to the ones I222ve read: 223If th
e heart is unobstructed, the result is love.224 
I222ve been talking a great deal
 about love these days even
 though I told you there222s 
nothing that can be said, real
ly, about love. We can only speak of nonlove. We can only 
speak of addictions. But of love itself nothing may be said explicitly.      SAYING NOTHING  ABOUT LOVE    How would 
I
 describe love? I decided to give 
you one of the meditations I222m writing 
in a new book of mine. I222ll 
read it to you slowly; you meditate on it as we go along, 
because I222ve got it put down in short form he
re so I can get it done in three or four   73  minutes; otherwise it would take me half an
 hour. It222s a comment on a gospel sentence. I 
had been thinking of another reflection, from 
Plato: 223One cannot make a slave of a free 
person, for a free person is free even in pris
on.224 It222s like another 
gospel sentence: 223If a 
person makes you go one mile, go two.224 You may think you222ve made a slave out of me 
by putting a load on my back, but you haven222t. If a person is trying to change external 
reality by being out of prison in order to be fr
ee, he is a prisoner indeed, Freedom lies not 
in external circumstances; freedom resides in
 the heart. When you have attained wisdom, 
who can enslave you? Anyhow, listen to the gos
pel sentence I had in mind earlier: 223He 
sent the people away, and afte
r doing that he went up to th
e mountain to pray alone. It 
grew late and he was there all by himself.224 
That222s
 what love is all about. Has it ever 
occurred to you that you can only love when 
you are alone? What does it mean to love? It 
means to see a person, a situation, a thing as it
 really is, not as you imagine it to be. And 
to give it the response it deserves. You can ha
rdly be said to love what you do not even 
see. And what prevents us from seeing? Our conditioning. Our concepts, our categories, 
our prejudices, our projections, the labels th
at we have drawn from our cultures and our 
past experiences. Seeing is the most arduous th
ing that a human can undertake, for it calls 
for a disciplined, alert mind. But most people would much rather 
lapse into mental 
laziness than take the trouble to see each pe
rson, each thing in its present moment of 
freshness.      LOSING CONTROL    If you wish to understand control, think of
 a little child that is given a taste for 
drugs. As the drugs penetrate the body of th
e child, it becomes addi
cted; its whole being 
cries out for the drug. To be 
without the drug is so unbearab
le a torment that it seems 
preferable to die. Think of that image 
227the body has gotten addicted to the drug. Now 
this is exactly what your society did to you 
when you were born. You were not allowed to 
enjoy the solid, nutritious food of life227name
ly, work, play, fun, laughter, the company 
of people, the pleasures of th
e senses and the mind. You were given a taste for the drug 
called approval, appr
eciation, attention.  I222m going to quote a great man here, a man named A. S. Neill. He is the author of 
Summerhill. Neill says that the sign of a sick child is that he is always hovering around 
his parents; he is interested in 
persons. The healthy child has no interest in persons, he is 
interested in 
things
. When a child is sure of his mother
222s love, he forgets his mother; he 
goes out to explore the world; 
he is curious. He looks for a frog to put in his mouth227that 
kind of thing. When a child is hovering around hi
s mother, it222s a bad sign; he222s insecure. 
Maybe his mother has been trying to suck love out
 of him, not give him all the freedom 
and assurance he wants. His mother222s always been threatening in many subtle ways to 
abandon him.  So we were given a taste of various dr
ug addictions: approval, attention, success, 
making it to the top, prestige, getting your name
 in the paper, power, being the boss. We 
were given a taste of things like being the 
captain of the team, leading the band, etc. 
Having a taste for these drugs, we became addicted and began to dread losing them. 
Recall the lack of control you felt, the terror 
at the prospect of failure or of making 
mistakes, at the prospect of criticism by 
others. So you became cravenly dependent on   74  others and you lost your freedom. Others 
now have the power to make you happy or 
miserable. You crave your drugs, but as much as you hate the suffering that this involves, 
you find yourself completely helpless. There is never a minute when, consciously or 
unconsciously, you are not aware of or attuned to
 the reactions of others, marching to the 
beat of their drums. A nice definition of
 an awakened person: a person who no longer 
marches to the drums of society, a person w
ho dances to the tune of the music that 
springs up from within. When you are ignor
ed or disapproved of, you experience a 
loneliness so unbearable that you crawl back 
to people and beg for the comforting drug 
called support and encouragement, reassurance.
 To live with people in this state involves 
a never-ending tension. 223Hell is other people,
224 said Sartre. How true. When you are in 
this state of dependency, you always have to 
be on your best behavior; you can never let 
your hair down; you222ve got to live up to expe
ctations. To be with 
people is to live in 
tension. To be without them brings the a
gony of loneliness, because you miss them. You 
have lost your capacity to see them exactly as they are and to respond to them accurately, 
because your perception of them is clouded by the need to get your drugs. You see them 
insofar as they are a support 
for getting your drug or a thr
eat to have your drug removed. 
You222re always looking at people, conscious
ly or unconsciously, through these eyes. Will 
I get what I want from them, will I not get 
what I want from them? And if they can 
neither support nor threaten my drug, I222m not 
interested in them. Th
at222s a horrible thing 
to say, but I wonder if there222s anyone 
here of whom this cannot be said.      LISTENING TO LIFE    Now, you need awareness and you need nourishment. You need good, healthy 
nourishment. Learn to enjoy the solid f
ood of life. Good food, good wine, good water. 
Taste them. Lose your mind and come to your
 senses. That222s good, healthy nourishment. 
The pleasures of the senses and the pleasur
es of the mind. Good reading, when you enjoy 
a good book. Or a really good discussion, or th
inking. It222s marvelous. Unfortunately, 
people have gone crazy, and they
222re getting more and more a
ddicted because they do not 
know how to enjoy the lovely th
ings of life. So they222re goin
g in for greater and greater 
artificial stimulants.  In the 1970s, President Carter appealed to 
the American people to go in for austerity. 
I thought to myself: He shouldn222t 
tell them to be austere, he should really tell them to 
enjoy things. Most of them have lost their capacity for enjoyment. I really believe that 
most people in affluent countri
es have lost that capacity. 
They222ve got to have more and 
more expensive gadgets; they can
222t enjoy the simple things of life. Then I walk into 
places where they have all the most marvel
ous music, and you get these records at a 
discount, they222re all stacked up, but I neve
r hear anybody listening to them227no time, no 
time, no time. They222re guilty, no time to en
joy life. They222re overworked, go, go, go. If 
you really enjoy life and the simple pleasur
es of the senses, you222d be amazed. You222d 
develop that extraordinary discip
line of the animal. An animal
 will never overeat. Left in 
its natural habitat, it will never be overweight
. It will never drink or eat anything that is 
not good for its health. You never find an animal smoking. It always exercises as much as 
it needs227watch your cat 
after it222s had its break
fast, look how it relaxes. And see how it 
springs into action, look at the suppleness 
of its limbs and the aliveness of its body.   75  We222ve lost that. We222re lost in our minds, in our
 ideas and ideals and so on, and its always 
go, go, go. And we222ve got an inner self-conf
lict which animals don222
t have. And we222re 
always condemning ourselves and making our
selves feel guilty. You know what I222m 
talking about. I could have said of myself wh
at one Jesuit friend said to me some years 
ago: Take that plate of sweets away, because in
 front of a plate of sweets or chocolates, I 
lose my freedom. That was true of me, too; 
I lost my freedom in front of all kinds of 
things, but no more! I222m satisfied with very 
little and I enjoy it intensely. When you have 
enjoyed something intensely, you need very li
ttle. It222s like people 
who are busy planning 
their vacation; they sp
end months planning it, and they 
get to the spot, 
and they222re all 
anxious about their reservations for flying b
ack. But they222re taking 
pictures alright, and 
later they222ll show you pictures in an 
album, of places they never saw but only 
photographed. That222s a symbol of modern li
fe. I cannot warn you enough about this kind 
of asceticism. Slow down and taste and smell 
and hear, and let your senses come alive. If 
you want a royal road to mysticism, sit down quietly and listen to
 all the sounds around 
you. You do not focus on any one sound; you try 
to hear them all. Oh, you222ll see the 
miracles that happen to you when your se
nses come unclogged. 
That is extremely 
important for the process of change.      THE END OF ANALYSIS    I want to give you a taste of the differe
nce between analysis 
and awareness, or 
information on the one hand and insight on the ot
her. Information is 
not insight, analysis 
is not awareness, knowledge is not awarene
ss. Suppose I walked in here with a snake 
crawling up my arm, and I said to you, 223Do 
you see the snake crawli
ng up my arm? I222ve 
just checked in an encyclopedia before comi
ng to this session and I found out that this 
snake is known as a Russell222s viper. If it bi
t me, I would die inside half a minute. Would 
you kindly suggest ways and means by which I c
ould get rid of this creature that is 
crawling up my arm?224 Who talks like this? I have informati
on, but I222ve got no awareness.  Or say I222m destroying myself with alc
ohol. 223Kindly describe ways and means by 
which I could get rid of this addiction.224 A person who would say th
at has no awareness. 
He knows he222s destroying himself, but he is no
t aware of it. If he 
were aware of it, the 
addiction would drop that minute. If I were aware of what the snake was, I wouldn222t 
brush it off my arm; 
it would get brushed off through me
. That222s what I222m talking about, 
that222s the change I222m talking about
. You don222t change yourself, it222s not 
me
 changing 
me
. 
Change takes place 
through you, in you. That222s about the most adequate way I can 
express it. You see change take place in 
you, through you; in your awareness, it happens. 
You
 don222t do it. When you222re doing it, it222s a ba
d sign; it won222t last. And if it does last, 
God have mercy on the people you222re living with
, because you222re going to be very rigid. 
People who are converted on the basis of 
self-hatred and self-dissatisfaction are 
impossible to live with. Somebody 
said, 223If you want to be a martyr, marry a saint.224 But 
in awareness, you keep your softness, your 
subtleness, your gentleness, your openness, 
your flexibility, and you don222t push, change occurs.  I remember a priest in Chicago when 
I was studying psychology there telling us, 
223You know, I had all the information I needed
; I knew that alcohol was killing me, and, 
believe me, nothing changes an 
alcoholic227not even the love of
 his wife or his kids. He   76  does love them but it doesn222t change him. I 
discovered one thing that changed me. I was 
lying in a gutter one day under a 
slight drizzle. I opened my ey
es and I saw that this was 
killing me. I saw it and I never had the desire 
to touch a drop after that. As a matter of 
fact, I222ve even drunk a bit si
nce then, but never enough to damage me. I couldn222t do it 
and still cannot do it.224 That222s
 what I222m talking about: awar
eness. Not information, but 
awareness.  A friend of mine who was given to exce
ssive smoking said, 223You know, there are all 
kinds of jokes about smoking. They tell us that tobacco kills people, but look at the 
ancient Egyptians; they222re all dead and none of them smoked.224 Well, one day he was 
having trouble with his lungs, so he went to 
our cancer research inst
itute in Bombay. The 
doctor said, 223Father, you222ve got
 two patches on your lungs. It
 could be cancer, so you222ll 
have to come back next month.224 He never to
uched another cigarette after that. Before, he 
knew
 it would kill him; now, he was 
aware
 it could kill him. That222s the difference.  The founder of my religious order, St. Igna
tius, has a nice expression for that. He 
calls it tasting and feeling the truth227not know
ing it, but tasting and feeling it, getting a 
feel for it. When you get a feel for it you 
change. When you know it 
in your head, you 
don222t.      DEAD AHEAD    I222ve often said to people that the way to really live is to die. The passport to living is 
to imagine yourself in your grave. Imagine 
that you222re lying in your coffin. Any posture 
you like. In India we put them in cross-legge
d. Sometimes they222re carried that way to the 
burning ground. Sometimes, though, they222re lying 
flat. So imagine you222re lying flat and 
you222re dead. Now look at your problems fr
om that viewpoint. Changes everything, 
doesn222t it?  What a lovely, lovely meditation. Do it 
every day if you have the time. It222s 
unbelievable, but you222ll come alive. I have 
a meditation about that in a book of mine, 
Wellsprings. You see the body decomposing, then bones, then dust. Every time I talk 
about this, people say, 223How disgusting!224 But wh
at222s so disgusting a
bout it? It222s reality, 
for heaven222s sake. But many of you don222t want 
to see reality. You don222
t want to think of 
death. People don222t live, most of you, you don222t 
live, you222re just k
eeping the body alive. 
That222s not life. You222re not living until it 
doesn222t matter a tinker222s damn to you whether 
you live or die. At that point you live. When
 you222re ready to lose your life, you live it. 
But if you222re protecting your life,
 you222re dead. If you222re sittin
g up there in th
e attic and I 
say to you, 223Come on down!224 and you say, 223Oh no, I222ve read about people going down 
stairs. They slip and they br
eak their necks; it222
s too dangerous.224 Or I can222t get you to 
cross the street because you 
say, 223You know how many people get run over when they 
cross the street?224 If
 I can222t get you to cross a str
eet, how can I get you to cross a 
continent? And if I can222t get 
you to peep out of your little 
narrow beliefs and convictions 
and look at another world, you222re dead, you222re
 completely dead; 
life has passed you by. 
You222re sitting in your little prison, where you222
re frightened; you222re going to lose your 
God, your religion, your friends, all 
kinds of things. Life is for the gambler, it really is. 
That222s what Jesus was saying. Are you ready 
to risk it? Do you know when you222re ready 
to risk it? When you222ve disc
overed that, when you know that 
this thing that people call   77  life is not really life. People mistakenly th
ink that living is keeping the body alive. So 
love the thought of death, love it. Go back 
to it again and again. 
Think of the loveliness 
of that corpse, of that skeleton, of those 
bones crumbling till there222
s only a handful of 
dust. From there on, what a relief, what a relief. Some of you probably don222t know what 
I222m talking about at this point; 
you222re too frightened to think of it. But it222s such a relief 
when you can look back on life from that perspective.  Or visit a graveyard. It222s an enormously
 purifying and beautiful experience. You 
look at this name and you sa
y, 223Gee, he lived so many year
s ago, two centuries ago; he 
must have had all the problems that I have, 
must have had lots of sleepless nights. How 
crazy, we live for such a short time. An Ital
ian poet said, 223We live 
in a flash of light; 
evening comes and it is night forever.224 It222s onl
y a flash and we waste 
it. We waste it with 
our anxiety, our worries, our 
concerns, our burdens. Now, as you make that meditation, 
you can just end up with information; but you 
may end up with awareness. And in that 
moment of awareness, you are 
new
. At least as long as it 
lasts. Then you222ll know the 
difference between information and awareness.  An astronomer friend was recently telling me
 some of the fundamental things about 
astronomy. I did not know, until he told me, that when you see the sun, you222re seeing it 
where it was eight and a half mi
nutes ago, not where it is now
. Because it takes a ray of 
the sun eight and a half minutes to get to us. 
So you222re not seeing it 
where it is; it222s now 
somewhere else. Stars, too, have been sendi
ng light to us for hundreds of thousands of 
years. So when we222re looking at them, they
 may not be where we222re seeing them; they 
may be somewhere else. He said that, if we 
imagine a galaxy, a whole universe, this earth 
of ours would be lost toward the tail end of
 the Milky Way; not even in the center. And 
every one of the stars is a sun and some suns
 are so big that they could contain the sun 
and the earth and the distance between them. 
At a conservative estimate, there are one 
hundred million galaxies! The universe, as we 
know it, is expanding at the rate of two 
million miles a second. I was fascinated listening to all of this, and when I came out of 
the restaurant where we were eating, I l
ooked up there and I ha
d a different feel, a 
different perspective on life. That222s awareness.
 So you can pick all this up as cold fact 
(and that222s information), or
 suddenly you get another pers
pective on life227what are we, 
what222s this universe, what222s human life? When you get that feel, that222s what I mean when 
I speak of awareness.        THE LAND OF LOVE    If we really dropped illusions for what they
 can give us or deprive us of, we would 
be alert. The consequence of not doing this
 is terrifying and unescapable. We lose our 
capacity to love. If you wish to love, you must 
learn to see again. And if you wish to see, 
you must learn to give up your drug. It222s as
 simple as that. Give up your dependency. 
Tear away the tentacles of society that 
have enveloped and suffocated your being. You 
must drop them. Externally, everything will go on as before, but though you will continue 
to be in
 the world, you will no longer be 
of
 it. In your heart, you will now be free at last, 
if utterly alone. Your dependence on your 
drug will die. You don222t have to go to the 
desert; you222re right in the mi
ddle of people; you222re enjoyi
ng them immensely. But they 
no longer have the power to make you happy or 
miserable. That222s what aloneness means.   78  In this solitude your dependence dies. The 
capacity to love is born. One no longer sees 
others as means of satisfying one222s addiction. Only someone who has attempted this 
knows the terrors of the process.
 It222s like inviting yourself to 
die. It222s like asking the poor 
drug addict to give up the only happiness he 
has ever known. How to replace it with the 
taste of bread and fruit and th
e clean taste of the morning ai
r, the sweetness of the water 
of the mountain stream? While he is struggl
ing with his withdrawal symptoms and the 
emptiness he experiences within himself now
 that his drug is gone, nothing can fill the 
emptiness except his drug. Can you imagine a life 
in which you refuse to enjoy or take 
pleasure in a single word of appreciation or 
to rest your head on anyone222s shoulder for 
support? Think of a life in which you depend on no one emotionally, so that no one has 
the power to make you happy or mise
rable anymore. You refuse to 
need
 any particular 
person or to be special to anyone or to ca
ll anyone your own. The bi
rds of the air have 
their nests and the foxes their 
holes, but you will have nowhere to
 rest your head in your 
journey through life. If you ever get to this st
ate, you will at last know what it means to 
see with a vision that is cl
ear and unclouded by fear or de
sire. Every word there is 
measured. 
To see at last with a vision that is
 clear and unclouded by fear or desire
. You 
will know what it means to love. But to come to the land of love, you must pass through 
the pains of death, for to love persons means 
to die to the need for persons, and to be 
utterly alone.  How would you ever get there? By a ceasel
ess awareness, by the infinite patience 
and compassion you would have for a drug a
ddict. By developing a taste for the good 
things in life to counter the craving for your
 drug. What good things? The love of work 
which you enjoy doing for the love of itself; 
the love of laughter 
and intimacy with 
people to whom you do not cling and on whom
 you do not depend emotionally but whose 
company you enjoy. It will also help if you 
take on activities that you can do with your 
whole being
, activities that you so love to do that 
while you222re engaged in them success, 
recognition, and approval simply do not mean 
a thing to you. It will help, too, if you 
return to nature. Send the crowds away, go 
up to the mountains, and silently commune 
with trees and flowers and animals and birds, 
with sea and clouds a
nd sky and stars. I222ve 
told you what a spiritual exercise it is to 
gaze at things, to be 
aware of things around you. 
Hopefully, the words will drop, the concepts 
will drop, and you will see, you will make 
contact with reality. That is the cure for l
oneliness. Generally, we seek to cure our 
loneliness through emotional dependence on 
people, through gregariousness and noise. 
That is no cure. Get back to things, get back
 to nature, go up in the mountains. Then you 
will know that your heart has brought you to the 
vast desert of solitude, there is no one 
there at your side, absolutely no one.  At first this will seem unbearable. But 
it is only because you are unaccustomed to 
aloneness. If you manage to stay there for a 
while, the desert will suddenly blossom into 
love. Your heart will burst into song. And it 
will be springtime forever; the drug will be 
out; you222re free. Then you will understand what freedom is, what love is, what happiness 
is, what reality is, what truth is, what
 God is. You will see, you will know beyond 
concepts and conditioning, addictions and 
attachments. Does that make sense?  Let me end this with a lovely story. There 
was a man who invented the art of making 
fire. He took his tools and went to a tribe in
 the north, where it was very cold, bitterly 
cold. He taught the people there to make 
fire. The people were very interested. He 
showed them the uses to which they could put fire227they could cook, could keep   79  themselves warm, etc. They were so grateful 
that they had learned 
the art of making fire. 
But before they could express their gratit
ude to the man, he disappeared. He wasn222t 
concerned with getting their r
ecognition or gratitude; he was 
concerned about their well-
being. He went to another tribe, where he 
again began to show them the value of his 
invention. People were interested there, too, a bit too interest
ed for the peace of mind of 
their priests, who began to notice that this 
man was drawing crowds and they were losing 
their popularity. So they decided 
to do away with him. They poisoned him, crucified him, 
put it any way you like. But they were afraid
 now that the people might turn against 
them, so they were very wise, even wil
y. Do you know what they did? They had a 
portrait of the man made and 
mounted it on the main altar of the temple. The instruments 
for making fire were placed in front of the 
portrait, and the people 
were taught to revere 
the portrait and to pay reveren
ce to the instruments of fire, which they dutifully did for 
centuries. The veneration and the wors
hip went on, but there was no fire.  Where222s the fire? Where222s the love? Wher
e222s the drug uprooted from your system? 
Where222s the freedom? This is what spirituality
 is all about. Tragically, we tend to lose 
sight of this, don222t we? This is what Jesus Ch
rist is all about. But we overemphasized the 
223Lord, Lord,224 didn222t we? Where222s the fire? And 
if worship isn222t leading to the fire, if 
adoration isn222t leading to love, if the litur
gy isn222t leading to a clearer perception of 
reality, if God isn222t lead
ing to life, of what use is religion except to create more division, 
more fanaticism, more antagonism? It is not from
 lack of religion in 
the ordinary sense of 
the word that the world is suffering, it is from lack of love, lack of 
awareness. And love is 
generated through awareness and through no 
other way, no other way. Understand the 
obstructions you are putting in the way of l
ove, freedom, and happiness and they will 
drop. Turn on the light of awareness and th
e darkness will disappear. Happiness is not 
something you acquire; love is not somethi
ng you produce; love is not something that 
you have; love is something that 
has
 you. You do not have the wind, the stars, and the 
rain. You don222t possess these th
ings; you surrender to them. 
And surrender occurs when 
you are aware of your illusions, when you ar
e aware of your addictions, when you are 
aware of your desires and fears. As I told 
you earlier, first, psyc
hological insight is a 
great help, not analysis, however; 
analysis is paralysis. Insight is not necessarily analysis. 
One of your great American therapists put 
it very well: 223It222s the 221Aha222 experience that 
counts.224 Merely analyzing gi
ves no help; it just gives in
formation. But if you could 
produce the 223Aha224 experience, that222s insight. 
That is change. Sec
ond, the understanding 
of your addiction is important. You need tim
e. Alas, so much time that is given to 
worship and singing praise and singing songs 
could so fruitfully be employed in self-
understanding. Community is not produced by 
joint liturgical ce
lebrations. You know 
deep down in your heart, and so do I, that such celebrations only
 serve to paper over 
differences. Community is created by understand
ing the blocks that we put in the way of 
community, by understanding the conflicts that ar
ise from our fears and our desires. At 
that point community arises. We must alwa
ys beware of making worship just another 
distraction from the importan
t business of living. And livi
ng doesn222t mean working in 
government, or being a big businessman, or pe
rforming great acts of charity. That isn222t 
living. Living is to have dropped all the impe
diments and to live in the present moment 
with freshness. 223The birds of the air . . . they
 neither toil nor spin224227that is living. I began 
by saying that people are asleep, dead. Dead people running governments, dead people 
running big business, dead people educating othe
rs; come alive! Worship must help this,   80  or else it222s useless. And increasingly227you 
know this and so do I227
we222re losing the youth 
everywhere. They hate us; they222re not intere
sted in having more fears and more guilts 
laid on them. They222re not interested in mo
re sermons and exhortations. But they are 
interested in learning about 
love. How can I be happy? How can I live? How can I taste 
these marvelous things that the mystic
s speak of? So that222s the second thing227
understanding. Third, don222t iden
tify. Somebody asked me as I was coming here today, 
223Do you ever feel low?224 Boy, do I feel low ev
ery now and then. I get my attacks. But 
they don222t last, they really don222t. What do I do
? First step: I don222t id
entify. Here comes a 
low feeling. Instead of getting tense about it, 
instead of getting irritated with myself about 
it, I understand I222m feeling depressed, disappoint
ed, or whatever. Second step: I admit the 
feeling is in me, not in the other person, e
.g., in the person who didn222t write me a letter, 
not in the exterior world; it222s in me. Because as long as I think it222s outside me, I feel 
justified in holding on to my feelings. I can222t
 say everybody would feel this way; in fact, 
only idiotic people would feel this way, only 
sleeping people. Third 
step: I don222t identify 
with the feeling. 223I224 is not th
at feeling. 223I224 am not lonely, 
223I224 am not depressed, 223I224 am 
not disappointed. Disappointment is 
there
, one watches it. You222d be amazed how quickly 
it glides away. Anything you222re
 aware of keeps changing; clouds keep moving. As you 
do this, you also get all kinds of insights into
 why clouds were coming in the first place.  I222ve got a lovely quote here, a few sentences
 that I would write in gold. I picked 
them up from A. S. Neill222s book 
Summerhill. I must give you the background. You 
probably know that Neill was in education 
for forty years. He developed a kind of 
maverick school. He took in boys and girls and ju
st let them be free. You want to learn to 
read and write, fine; you don222t wa
nt to learn to read and wr
ite, fine. You can do anything 
you want with your life, provided you don222t inte
rfere with the freedom of someone else. 
Don222t interfere with someone else222s freedom; 
otherwise you222re free. He says that the 
worst ones came to him from convent school. This
 was in the old days, of course. He said 
it took them about six months to get over all 
the anger and the resentment that they had 
repressed. They222d be rebelling for six months
, fighting the system. The worst was a girl 
who would take a bicycle and ride into tow
n, avoiding class, avoi
ding school, avoiding 
everything. But once they got over their rebel
lion, everybody wanted to
 learn; they even 
began protesting, 223Why don222t we have class toda
y?224 But they would onl
y take what they 
were interested in. They222d be transformed. 
In the beginning parents 
were frightened to 
send their children to this 
school; they said, 223How can 
you educate them if you don222t 
discipline them? You222ve got to 
each them, guide them.224 What was the secret of Neill222s 
success? He222d get the worst children, th
e ones everybody else had despaired of, and 
within six months they222d all be transforme
d. Listen to what he said227extraordinary 
words, holy words. 223Every child has a god in 
him. Our attempts to mold the child will 
turn the god into a devil. Ch
ildren come to my school, little devils, hating the world, 
destructive, unmannerly, lyi
ng, thieving, bad-tempered. In 
six months they are happy, 
healthy children who do no evil.224 These ar
e amazing words coming from a man whose 
school in Britain is regularly
 inspected by people from the 
Ministry of Education, by any 
headmaster or headmistress or anyone who 
would care to go there. Amazing. It was his 
charism. You don222t do this kind of thing from 
a blueprint; you222ve got 
to be a special kind 
of person. In some of his lect
ures to headmasters and headmi
stresses he says, 223Come to 
Summerhill and you222ll find that a
ll the fruit trees are laden wi
th fruit; nobody222s taking the 
fruits off the trees; there222s no desire to attack authority; they222re well fed and there222s no   81  resentment and anger. Come to Summer
hill and you222ll never find a handicapped child 
with a nickname (you know how cruel kids
 can be when someone stammers). You222ll 
never find anyone needling a stammerer, never.
 There222s no violence in those children, 
because no one is practicing violence on them
, that222s why.224 Listen to these words of 
revelation, sacred words. We have people in 
the world like this. No
 matter what scholars 
and priests and theologians tell you, ther
e are and have been people who have no 
quarrels, no jealousies, no conflicts, no wa
rs, no enmities, none! They exist in my 
country, or, sad to say, they existed until rela
tively recently. I222ve had Jesuit friends go out 
to live and work among people 
who, they assured me, were incapable of stealing or lying. 
One Sister said to me that when she went 
to the northeast of India to work among some 
tribes there, the people woul
d lock up nothing. Nothing was ever stolen and they never 
told lies227until the Indian government and missionaries showed up.  Every child has a god in him; our attempts to mold the child will turn the god into a 
devil.  There222s a lovely Italian film directed by Federico Fellini, 
8 1/2. In one scene there222s 
a Christian Brother going out on 
a picnic or excursion with 
a group of eight- to ten-year-
old boys. They222re on a beach, moving right on ah
ead while the Brother brings up the rear 
with three or four of them around him. They
 come across an older woman who222s a whore, 
and they say to her, 223Hi,224 and she says
, 223Hi.224 And they say, 223Who are you?224 And she 
says, 223I222m a prostitute.224 They don222t know what
 that is but they pretend to. One of the 
boys, who seems a bit more knowing than the ot
hers, says, 223A prostitute is a woman who 
does certain things if you pay her.224 They 
ask, 223Would she do those 
things if we paid 
her?224 223Why not?224 the answer came. So they 
take up a collection and give her the money, 
saying, 223Would you do certain things now that we222ve given you the money?224 She 
answers, 223Sure, kids, what do you want me to 
do?224 The only thing that occurs to the kids 
is for her to take her clothes off. So she does. Well, they look at her; they222ve never seen a 
woman naked before. They don222t know what else to do, so they say, 223Would you dance?224 
She says, 223Sure.224 So they all gather round singing and clapping; the whore is moving her 
behind and they222re enjoying themselves immens
ely. The Brother sees all this. He runs 
down the beach and yells at the woman. He gets her to put her clothes on, and the 
narrator says, 223At that moment, the children we
re spoiled; until then they were innocent, 
beautiful.224  This is not an unusual problem. I know a rath
er conservative missionary in India, a 
Jesuit. He came to a workshop of mine. As I developed this theme over two days, he 
suffered. He came to me the second night 
and said, 223Tony, I can222t explain to you how 
much I222m suffering listening to you.224 I sai
d, 223Why, Stan?224 He sa
id, 223You222re reviving 
within me a question that I suppressed for 
twenty-five years, a 
horrible question. Again 
and again I asked myself: Have I not spoile
d my people by making them Christian?224 This 
Jesuit was not one of your liberals, he wa
s an orthodox, devout, pious, conservative man. 
But he felt he spoiled a happy, loving, simple
, guileless people by making them Christian.  American missionaries who went to the S
outh Sea Islands with their wives were 
horrified to see women coming bare-breasted 
to church. The wives insisted that the 
women should be more decently dressed. So th
e missionaries gave them shirts to wear. 
The following Sunday the women came wearing th
eir shirts but with two big holes cut 
out for comfort, for ventilation. They 
were right; the missionaries were wrong.  Now . . . back to Neill. He says, 223And I am no genius, I am merely a man who   82  refuses to guide the steps of children.224 But wh
at, then, of original sin? Neill says that 
every child has a god in him; our attempts to 
mold him will turn the god into a devil. He 
lets children form their own values, and th
e values are invariably good and social. Can 
you believe that? When a child feels loved (w
hich means: when a child feels you222re on 
his side), he222s O.K. The child doesn222t e
xperience violence anymore. No fear, so no 
violence. The child begins to treat others the 
way he has been treate
d. You222ve got to read 
that book. It222s a holy book, it real
ly is. Read it; it revolutioni
zed my life and my dealings 
with people. I began to see miracles. I began 
to see the self-dissatisfaction that had been 
ingrained in me, the compet
ition, the comparisons, the th
at222s-not-good-enough, etc. You 
might object that if they hadn222t pushed me, 
I wouldn222t have become what I am. Did I 
need all that pushing? And anyway, who want
s to be what I am? I want to be happy, I 
want to be holy, I want to be 
loving, I want to be at peace, I 
want to be free, I want to be 
human.  Do you know where wars come from? They co
me from projecting outside of us the 
conflict that is inside. Show 
me an individual in whom there is no inner self-conflict and 
I222ll show you an individual in whom there is 
no violence. There will be effective, even 
hard, action in him, but no hatred. When he act
s, he acts as a surge
on acts; when he acts, 
he acts as a loving teacher acts with mentally retarded children. You don222t blame them, 
you understand; but you swing into action. On
 the other hand, when you swing into 
action with your own hatred and your 
own violence unaddressed, you222ve compounded 
the error. You222ve tried to put 
fire out with more fire. You222ve
 tried to deal with a flood by 
adding water to it. I repeat what Neill said: 
223Every child has a god in him. Our attempts 
to mold the child will turn th
e god into a devil. Children come to my school, little devils, 
hating the world, destructive, unmannerly, ly
ing, thieving, bad-tempered. In six months 
they are happy, healthy childre
n who do no evil. And I am no genius, I am merely a man 
who refuses to guide the steps of children. I le
t them form their own values and the values 
are invariably good and social. The religi
on that makes people good makes people bad, 
but the religion known as freedom makes 
all people good, for it destroys the inner 
conflict [I222ve added the word 223inne
r224] that makes people devils.224  Neill also says, 223The first thing I do when 
a child comes to Summerhill is destroy its 
conscience.224 I assume you know what he222s 
talking about, because I know what he222s 
talking about. You don222t need conscience when you have consciousness; you don222t need 
conscience when you have sens
itivity. You222re not 
violent, you222re not fearful. You 
probably think this is an unattainable ideal
. Well, read that bo
ok. I have run into 
individuals, here and there,
 who suddenly stumble upon this 
truth: The root of evil is 
within you. As you begin to understand this
, you stop making demands on yourself, you 
stop having expectations of yourself, 
you stop pushing yourself and you understand. 
Nourish yourself on wholesome food, good whol
esome food. I222m not talking about actual 
food, I222m talking about sunsets, about 
nature, about a good movie, about a good book, 
about enjoyable work, about good comp
any, and hopefully you will break your 
addictions to those other feelings.  What kind of feeling comes upon you when you222re in touch with nature, or when 
you222re absorbed in work that you love? Or 
when you222re really conversing with someone 
whose company you enjoy in openness and in
timacy without cli
nging? What kind of 
feelings do you have? Compare those feelings
 with the feelings you have when you win 
an argument, or when you win a race, or when you become popular, or when everybody222s   83  applauding you. The latter feelings I call worldly 
feelings; the former 
feelings I call soul 
feelings. Lots of people gain the world and 
lose their soul. Lots of people live empty, 
soulless lives because they222re feeding them
selves on popularity, appreciation, and praise, 
on 223I222m O.K., you222re O.K.,224 look at me, atte
nd to me, support me, value me, on being the 
boss, on having power, on winning the race. Do you feed yourself on that? If you do, 
you222re dead. You222ve lost your soul. Feed 
yourself on other, more nourishing material. 
Then you222ll see the transformati
on. I222ve given you a whole pr
ogram for life, haven222t I?     84                                        ANTHONY DE MELLO, S .J., was the director of the Sadhana
