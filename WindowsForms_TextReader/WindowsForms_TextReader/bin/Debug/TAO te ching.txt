perpetrated by Ron Hogan 
copyright 2002, 2004   (see back for details)    "eternal mystery" and whatnot.   
 
But the beauty of the book isn't in its language, at least 
not for me--it's in the practical advice Lao Tzu offers us 
about how to live a productive, meaningful life on a day 
to day basis.  What I wanted
 to do was to make that 
advice as clear to a modern American reader as it would 
have been to the guard who first asked Lao Tzu to write 
it down. 
 
I worked through the first twenty chapters, then put the 
rough draft up on my website under a pseudonym I 
used online back in those days. A bunch of fan mail 
came in, so I kept plugging away at the text, then my 
hard drive collapsed and all my files were completely 
erased.  I was freelancing pre
tty steadily then, and what 
little free time I had I spent building my own website, so 
the TTC went on hold.  I got an occasional email asking 
about the other chapters, 
and I developed a stock 
answer.  When it was time for me to finish the job, I 
told people, I would. 
 
Years went by.  I'd left LA for San Francisco, then 
moved up to Seattle, chasing after big dotcom money.  
It was great for a while, but as Lao Tzu says, "If you 
give things too much value, you're going to get ripped 
off."  In the middle of the worst of the frustration, I  
rediscovered the Tao Te Ching, and realized I needed to 
finish what I started. 
 
I dug out all my old copies of the TTC and went 
shopping for more versions, some of which were even 
better than the ones I'd found the first time.  Brian 
Browne Walker's translation comes close to the modern 
oral quality I was striving for, though his voice is still 
much more of an "Eastern sage" voice than mine.  David 
Hinton is somewhat more poetic, but I think he does a 
wonderful job of capturing what Lao Tzu may have 
actually sounded like to his contemporaries.  And Ursula 
K. LeGuin strikes a balance between the modern and 
classical voices that gave me a new perspective on Tao; 
her commentaries on several chapters are enlightening 
as well. 
 
I wish I could say that I wr
ote the remaining sixty-one 
chapters in a hurried creative frenzy, but things took a 
little longer than I thought.  I got distracted by the 
decision to move to New York City, and though I did get 
some work done on the book, it was a little over a year 
later, when (and, yes, I know how cliched this sounds) 
the planes crashed into the World Trade Center and I 
realized I'd still been wasting too much of my life on 
things that didn't pan out.  Instead of talking about 
getting serious about my life, it was time to actually do 
it.  (Living through the following two and a half years 
has also made me appreciate chapters 30 and 31 a lot 
more, for reasons that will become readily apparent.) 
 
So here you are--with my own name attached, as the 
pseudonym has long since falle
n away.  From a scholar's 
point of view, this TTC is unfaithful to the original text 
on more than one occasion, if not in every single line.  
Case in point: in chapter 20, Lao Tzu didn't exactly say, 
"Don't spend too much time thinking about stupid shit."  
For all the liberties I've take
n with his words, however, 
I've made every attempt to stay true to his message,  
and I hope you'll find something useful in my efforts.

 PART ONE TAO (THE WAY) 
      8. 
 
"Doing the right thing" is like water. 
It's good for all living things, and flows without thinking 
about where it's going 
 
...just like Tao. 
 
Keep your feet on the ground. 
Remember what's important. 
Be there when people need you. 
Say what you mean. 
Be prepared for anything. 
Do whatever you can,  
whenever it needs doing. 
 
If you don't  
compare yourself to others, 
nobody can compare to you. 
 
 
9. 
 
If you drink too much, you get drunk. 
The engine won't start  
if you're always tinkering with it. 
 
If you hoard wealth, 
you fall into its clutches. 
If you crave success, 
you succumb to failure. 
 
Do what you have to do,  
then walk away. 
Anything else will drive you nuts. 
 
    14. 
 
You can't see Tao,  
no matter how hard you look. 
You can't hear Tao,  
no matter how hard you listen. 
You can't hold on to Tao,  
no matter how hard you grab. 
 
But it's there. 
 
It's in you, and it's all around you. 
 
Remember that. 
 
 
15. 
 
The ancient Masters  
were damn impressive. 
They were deep.  Real deep. 
Words can't even begin to describe  
how deep they were. 
You can only talk  
about how they acted. 
 
They were careful,  
like a man walking on thin ice. 
They were cautious,  
like a soldier behind enemy lines. 
They were polite, 
like a guest at a party. 
They moved quickly, like melting ice.  
They were as plain as a block of wood. 
Their minds were as wide as a valley, 
and their hearts as clear  
as spring water. 
 
Can you wait  
for that kind of openness and clarity 
before you try to understand the world? 
 
Can you hold still 
until events have unfolded 
before you do the right thing? 
 
When you act without expectations, 
you can accomplish great things. 
 
    20. 
 
Don't spend too much time  
thinking about stupid shit. 
Why should you care 
if people agree or disagree with you? 
Why should you care  
if others find you attractive or not? 
Why should you care  
about things that worry others? 
Call bullshit on all that. 
 
Let other people  
get worked up  
and try to enjoy themselves. 
I'm not going to give myself away. 
A baby doesn't know how to smile,  
but it's still happy. 
 
Let other people 
get excited about stuff. 
I'm not going to hang on to anything. 
I'm not going to fill my mind with ideas. 
I'm not going to get stuck in a rut,  
tied down to any one place. 
 
Other people are clever; 
I guess I must be stupid. 
Other people have goals; 
I guess I must be aimless. 
Like the wind.  Or the waves. 
 
I'm not like other people. 
I'm getting right with Tao. 
21. 
 
A Master stays focused on Tao. 
Nothing else, just Tao. 
 
But you can't pin Tao down-- 
you can't even see it! 
How are you supposed to focus on something like that? 
 
Just remember what Lao Tzu said:  
The universe began as a void. 
The void fills with images. 
Images lead to the creation of objects. 
And every object has Tao at its core. 
 
That's the way it's been,  
ever since the world began. 
How can I be so sure? 
I just know. 
 
   23. 
 
When you have nothing to say, 
you may as well keep your mouth shut. 
The wind and the rain  
don't go on forever. 
If nature knows enough  
to give it a rest sometimes, 
so should you. 
 
If you're ready for Tao, 
 you can live with Tao. 
If you're ready to succeed, 
you can live with success. 
If you're ready to fail,  
you can live with failure. 
 
Trust your instincts,  
and others will trust you. 
 
 
24. 
 
Keep your feet firmly planted 
unless you want to fall on your face. 
Learn how to pace yourself  
if you want to get anywhere. 
Don't call attention to yourself  
if you want people to notice your work. 
 
Nobody respects people  
who always have excuses. 
Nobody gives credit to people  
who always take it. 
People who hype themselves  
have nothing else to offer. 
 
Think of being in touch with Tao  
like eating at a buffet: 
Take only what you need. 
Save some for everybody else. 
 
     31. 
 
Weapons are terrible things. 
If you want to get right with Tao, 
reject weapons. 
 
The Master,  
knowing all things came from Tao, 
recognizes what he has in common  
with his enemies 
and always tries to avoid conflict. 
 
But when there is no other choice, 
he uses force reluctantly. 
He does so with great restraint, 
and never celebrates a victory; 
to do so would be to rejoice in killing. 
A person who would rejoice in killing 
has completely lost touch with Tao. 
 
When you win a war,  
you preside over a funeral. 
Pay your respects to the dead. 
 
 
32. 
 
Tao is an eternal mystery, 
so small you can never take hold of it. 
 
If a leader gets right with Tao, 
people will follow him on instinct. 
All will be right with the world. 
People will do the right thing  
without being told. 
 
Everything that comes from Tao  
needs a name. 
But once everything has its name,  
you should make no other distinction between things. 
This prevents you 
from becoming trapped by them. 
 
Everything in the universe is full of Tao  
and leads to Tao, 
just like the water in rivers  
that flows into oceans. 
 
  33. 
 
Knowing things makes you smart, 
but knowing yourself makes you wise. 
To rule others, you must be powerful, 
but to rule yourself,  
you must be strong. 
 
If you have only what you need,  
you have true wealth. 
If you never give up,  
you will find a way. 
If you stay true to yourself, 
you will never be lost. 
If you stay alive your whole life, 
you've really lived. 
 
 
34. 
 
Tao flows in all directions. 
It's in everything,  
but nothing can contain it. 
Everything needs Tao, 
so Tao provides, 
and never expects anything in return. 
 
Everything comes from Tao, 
but Tao doesn't call attention to itself. 
It wants for nothing.  
Think nothing of it. 
 
Everything leads to Tao, 
but Tao doesn't call attention to itself. 
Pretty impressive, huh? 
 
It doesn't strive for success.  
That's why it succeeds. 
 
  35. 
 
When you get right with Tao,  
everybody wants to be your friend. 
When they're around you,  
they can relax and enjoy themselves. 
 
People can be easily distracted  
by music or good food. 
When we try to talk about Tao,  
it seems boring by comparison. 
 
It doesn't look like much. 
It doesn't sound like much. 
But no matter how much you use,  
there's still plenty left. 
 
 
36. 
 
To make something smaller, 
you need to appreciate its size. 
To make something weaker, 
you must recognize its strength. 
To get rid of something, 
you need to hold it tight. 
To take something, 
you must give it up entirely. 
 
To put it another way: 
Sensitivity and weakness  
overcome unfeeling strength. 
 
  37. 
 
Tao never does anything  
but nothing is left undone. 
 
If our leaders  
could get in touch with Tao, 
the world would take care of itself. 
Even if they wanted  
to impose their own ideas, 
they'd be drawn back to Tao's  
nameless simplicity. 
 
When our lives are that simple,  
we want for nothing. 
We can relax,  
and the world becomes a better place.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 PART TWO TE (POWER)  38. 
 
People with integrity  
don't even think about it. 
That's how you can tell  
they have integrity. 
Other people talk about  
how much integrity they have, 
when they really don't have much.  
If any. 
 
Truly powerful people  
don't do anything,  
but they get the job done. 
Other people are always busy  
doing something, 
but nothing ever gets done. 
 
When kind people act, 
they do so without thinking about it. 
When the just act, 
they're always sure  
they're doing the right thing. 
But when the righteous act,  
and nobody reacts, 
they try to force everyone  
to do things their way. 
 
If you're not in touch with Tao,  
at least you can still have integrity. 
If you don't have integrity,  
there's always kindness. 
If you don't have kindness,  
there's always justice. 
If you don't have justice, 
all you have left is righteousness.   40. 
 
Tao is always heading  
back to where it came from. 
Tao advances by not pressing forward. 
 
Things exist because they are. 
They are because they once were not. 
 
 
41. 
 
When a wise person hears about Tao,  
he gets right with it. 
When an ordinary person  
hears about Tao, 
he tries to get right with it,  
but eventually gives up. 
When a fool hears about Tao,  
he just laughs and laughs. 
If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be Tao. 
 
Here's what they find so funny: 
The path to enlightenment  
seems covered in shadows. 
The way forward 
 feels like taking a step back. 
The easiest path seems difficult. 
Those with the most virtue  
seem debased. 
Those who are most pure  
seem to be grubby and soiled. 
The deepest thoughts appear shallow. 
The greatest strength 
looks like weakness. 
What is most real  
strikes us as imaginary. 
The largest space has no boundaries. 
The greatest talent  
seems to produce nothing. 
The greatest voice is unhearable. 
The greatest beauty is invisible. 
 
Tao is hidden to us 
and it has no name. 
It is the source and the strength of all things.     48. 
 
Usually,  
we try to learn something new every day. 
 
But if we want to get right with Tao, 
we have to let go of something every day. 
 
We do less and less,  
until we end up doing nothing. 
And it's when we do nothing 
that we get the job done. 
 
Let events take their course,  
and everything will turn out 
in your favor. 
If you act on your ambitions,  
they will never pan out. 
 
 
49. 
 
The Masters  
don't make up their minds. 
They turn their thoughts 
to other people. 
 
They are good to good people,  
and they're good to bad people. 
This is real goodness. 
 
They have faith in the faithful,  
and they have faith in the unfaithful. 
This is real faith. 
 
A Master throws himself  
into the world completely, 
forgetting everything he's been told. 
People pay attention to him 
because he lives a life of child-like wonder. 
 
    54. 
 
Tao's power is so deeply entrenched  
it can never be uprooted. 
Tao's power clings so tightly 
it can never slip away. 
It will endure for generations. 
 
If you get in touch  
with the power of Tao, 
it will become real. 
If your family gets in touch  
with the power of Tao, 
the power will flourish. 
 
If your community gets in touch  
with the power of Tao, 
the power will grow even stronger. 
If your country gets in touch  
with the power of Tao, 
the power will become abundant. 
 
If the world gets in touch  
with the power of Tao, 
the power will be everywhere. 
 
How can I know this? 
I just do. 
 
 
55. 
 
A person filled with the power of Tao  
is like a baby boy: 
bees can't sting him,  
wild beasts can't attack him. 
 
A baby has soft bones  
and weak muscles,  
but a firm grip. 
He hasn't had sex,  
but he can get an erection. 
That's because he's got lots of energy. 
He can cry all day 
and never lose his voice. 
That's because he's at one with his world. 
 
If you're at one with the world,  
you know constancy. 
And if you know constancy,  
you've been enlightened. 
 
It's not healthy  
to try to prolong your life. 
It's unnatural to impose the mind's will  
upon the body. 
People waste time and energy 
trying to be strong or beautiful, 
and their strength and beauty fade. 
They've lost touch with Tao, 
and when you lose touch with Tao, 
you might as well be dead. 
 
    60. 
 
Being a leader 
 is like cooking a small fish; 
get right with Tao,  
and it's quick and easy. 
 
When you're in touch with Tao, 
you don't need to worry  
about misfortune. 
You can't make it go away, of course, 
but you can keep it  
from harming other people. 
 
Also, as a wise leader,  
you cause no harm to others, 
so people won't have to worry  
about getting hurt, 
and they'll take the opportunity  
to do the right thing. 
 
 
61. 
 
Power flows down 
to every level of existence 
like a river to the ocean. 
 
Victory comes  
from lying perfectly still 
and waiting for power  
to come your way. 
 
If you yield to someone  
less powerful than yourself, 
you will be in a position  
to influence them. 
 
If you submit to someone  
more powerful than yourself, 
you create an opportunity  
to get your own way. 
 
So if you want to get ahead,  
lay low and bide your time. 
That way, everybody's happy. 
 
  62. 
 
Every living thing  
gets its strength from Tao. 
Good people respect the value of Tao. 
The wicked and foolish don't, 
but Tao provides for them anyway. 
 
Some people gain power and prestige 
through fancy words, 
others through great deeds. 
But Tao is available to everyone,  
not just the powerful. 
So don't look down on anybody. 
 
When people become powerful, 
and everybody lines up  
to kiss their ass, 
sit still and stay right with Tao. 
 
Why have the Masters  
always respected Tao? 
Because when you get right with Tao, 
you can always find  
what you need to get by, 
and trouble can never find you. 
 
 
63. 
 
Keep still. 
Don't work so hard. 
Learn to appreciate everyday life. 
Pay attention to details. 
Start small and work your way up. 
When people give you trouble,  
let it slide. 
 
Break everything down to its essentials. 
Get the job done  
before it becomes a chore. 
 
With the right preparation, 
difficult tasks  
can be completed with ease; 
every major project  
consists of simple steps. 
 
The Masters don't take on  
more than they can handle, 
which is why  
they can do just about anything. 
 
Don't promise  
more than you can deliver, 
and don't underestimate the task: 
You'll only make things harder for yourself. 
 
The Masters are always aware  
of the difficulties involved, 
which is why  
they never have to deal with them.   65. 
 
In ancient times,  
leaders who were right with Tao 
didn't teach everybody  
how to become enlightened. 
They kept people's lives simple. 
 
People who know too much  
can't be taught anything. 
Leaders who try to be clever  
always screw things up. 
Leaders who keep things simple 
always make things right. 
 
If you get that, 
you'll understand 
the mysterious power of Tao. 
 
That kind of power is so deep,  
so extensive, 
it penetrates into every level of existence. 
 
 
66. 
 
An ocean is greater  
than the hundred rivers  
that flow into it, 
and all it does is wait  
to receive what they bring. 
 
If you want to teach people,  
don't talk down to them. 
If you want to lead them,  
find out where they want to go. 
 
People love leaders  
who make them feel safe  
without smothering them. 
They'll always support  
a leader like that, 
and because he doesn't try  
to compete with anybody, 
nobody is able to compete with him. 
 
      74. 
 
If people's lives suck,  
and they look forward to death, 
what good does it do  
to threaten to kill them? 
 
If people are afraid to die,  
and the wicked are condemned to death, 
then who would dare to commit evil? 
 
But that doesn't mean you or I  
can just take life and death  
into our own hands. 
That'd be like walking up  
to an industrial buzzsaw  
and trying to use it  
without any training. 
We'd only end up hurting ourselves. 
 
 
75. 
 
People starve  
because the government  
taxes them to death. 
People rebel  
because the government  
tries to run their lives. 
People act like life is meaningless 
because the government  
takes everything they have. 
 
People who know how to enjoy life 
are wiser than people who value their lives. 
 
  76. 
 
A baby's body is soft and gentle. 
A corpse is hard and stiff. 
Plants and trees are tender  
and full of sap. 
Dead leaves are brittle and dry. 
 
If you are rigid and unyielding, 
you might as well be dead. 
If you are soft and flexible,  
you are truly alive. 
 
Soldiers trained to fight to the death will die. 
A tree that cannot bend with the wind  
will snap. 
 
Here's a useful saying: 
The harder they come,  
the harder they fall. 
 
Here's another: 
The meek shall inherit the earth. 
 
 
77. 
 
Lao Tzu said using Tao  
was like pulling on a bowstring: 
The top bends down,  
the bottom bends up, 
and all the energy  
is focused in the middle. 
 
Tao takes energy from where it is, 
and sends it where it needs to be. 
But most people take from those  
who don't have enough, 
so those who have too much already  
can have more. 
 
So who in this world  
is truly generous to others? 
People who are in touch with Tao. 
They do their work  
without taking credit. 
They get the job done and move on. 
They aren't interested in showing off.

terms of this License. Individ
uals or entities who have 
received Collective Works from You under this License, 
however, will not have their licenses terminated 
provided such individuals or entities remain in full 
compliance with those licenses.

and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  
b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license 
granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the 
applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the 
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
under different license terms or to stop distributing  
the Work at any time; provided, however that any such 
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any 
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
under the terms of this License), and this License will 
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as 
stated above.  
 
 
8. Miscellaneous  
 
a.Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform 
the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the 
recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and  
conditions as the license granted to You under this 
License.  
b.If any provision of this License is invalid or 
unenforceable under applicable
 law, it shall not affect 
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
terms of this License, and without further action by the 
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be  
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make 
such provision valid and enforceable.  
c.No term or provision of th
is License shall be deemed 
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver 
or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to 
be charged with such waiver or consent.  
d.This License constitutes the entire agreement between 
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. 
There are no understandings, agreements or 
representations with respect to the Work not specified 
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional  
provisions that may appear in any communication from 
You. This License may not be modified without the 
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
